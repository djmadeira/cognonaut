Growing up in evangelical churches, I was warned time and again that the belief in and worship of God was the cornerstone holding the universe together. Without the certain knowledge of God in my heart, all the world would seem a cacophonous confusion of suffering and death, an endless series of mechanical spasms shoving each other through infinite space and time; in short, nihilism. And indeed, from when I began to lose my faith as a pre teen, up into my 20s, that's exactly how the world felt to me. An intolerable, unredeemed place which lacked even the capacity for redemption. But sadly, the fact that the prophecy came true was of no help to me. Because conviction, whether we possess it or lack it, by definition is that part of us which cannot submit to what is psychologically or socially beneficial. I would have given anything to believe in an all loving and all powerful God, to put an end to the torment I inflicted on myself and the bitterness I harbored against the world. But my unfaith would not yield to what I so desperately wanted to be true. No wishing or pleading could wipe away the simple truth carved into on my heart: "Rain falls on the good and the bad alike; an unjust world cannot be the product of an all-loving and all-powerful God; he is either indifferent to human affairs, or he does not exist."

While my core belief about the world, namely that there is no final guarantor of justice, has not changed, I've always found the equation of this belief with nihilism to be irritating. Conservative public figures like Jordan Peterson often diagnose modern society as nihilistic, drawing heavily on thinkers like Friedrich Nietzsche and Fyodor Dostoyevski. But my primary motivating ethic, the very thing that makes belief in God impossible for Nietzsche, myself, and I suspect also for Peterson, is precisely a rejection of nihilism. If the evidence suggests that we cannot justifiably believe in God, a fixed human nature, or other beliefs which have unquestionably been of use to human societies, we cannot *make* ourselves believe them simply because it is beneficial to do so. In the words of Martin Heidegger, an atheist with all the fear and trembling of the devout:

> Only a god can still save us. I think the only possibility of salvation left to us is to prepare readiness, through thinking and poetry, for the appearance of the god or for the absence of the god during the decline; so that we do not, simply put, die meaningless deaths, but that when we decline, we decline in the face of the absent god.<sup><a id="foot1" href="#cite1">1</a></sup>

In other words, even if you believe a world without God is intolerable, unstable, and unsustainable, better to decline in truth than to prosper in a lie. The conditions of modernity have conspired to make it so no one who is dependent on the modern societies for their survival can totally escape the dangerous spirit of questioning. In order to resolve this anxiety, conservatives finds scapegoats; it is not you who feels uncertain in the face of an overwhelming torrent of possible beliefs about the world, it is Critical Race Theorists, Post-Modern Neo-Marxists, and Gender Ideologues who are producing dangerous, motivated ideas to attack and pervert your correct, self-evident, eternal way of seeing the world. It is not that your beliefs are difficult to maintain in a world of instantaneous communication and unprecedented growth of the natural sciences; the problem is that they are under attack by people who are not fighting fair, people who fear and resent your beliefs.

But there is something contradictory about this narrative. If the scapegoating accounts of nihilism in conservative media were right, conservatives would have nothing to fear from progressives; after all, they have meaning and purpose, founded in self evident and unshakable faith; what could godless, decadent liberal elites offer to compete with such assurance? Why do children need to be protected, through censorship and withdrawal from public life, from ideas which are transparently empty and unsatisfying? And yet churches, along with every other institution of collective life, continue to hemorrhage membership. Those that remain resort to increasingly illiberal means to maintain themselves and their children in their beliefs, and become increasingly violent towards anyone who threatens those beliefs. Just as something feels unmistakably weak and unmanly about someone who constantly talks about masculinity, the conservative fixation on nihilism carries a whiff of confession. The truth is that there *is* an ongoing crisis of meaning in modernity, which *no one has thus far been able to once and for all surmount*; though many have lived beautiful lives, made magnificent works, and deepened the hues of the problem, precisely by refusing to displace it onto easy scapegoats. In the face of such difficulty, the only truly nihilistic thing to do is to shut one's eyes, stop one's ears, and pretend to a certainty which one cannot justifiably posses.

With that in mind, I'd like to trace the contours of the crisis of meaning, through the lens of of how American Evangelicals, Conservatives, and the various currents that mix therein, talk about it. I'll start with a brief discussion of the origin of the western conception of meaning and purpose; next, I hope to clarify what I believe conservatives mean when they attribute to modernity a crisis of meaning; I'll then sketch a rough picture of how I think nihilism ought rightly to be understood; and lastly, I'll explore how Evangelicals' intentional distortion of natural history, a natural history pioneered almost exclusively by devout Christian ministers, is itself the height of nihilism.

# Meaning and Purpose

![Life is meaningless / life is unbearably meaningful / ayyy lmao](/meaningful.jpg)

"What is the meaning of life?" seems at first glance like a simple, obvious question, which any philosopher worth the name ought to be able to answer. But the question itself neatly hides all sorts of metaphysical assumptions which have to be first unpacked before the question can even be posed. For example, "meaning" is a feature of language; words generally to refer to an something happening in this thing we call reality. For example, the word "tree" refers to the set of objects which have roots, hard bark-covered trunks, branches, and leaves. Even when words refer to something abstract, like countries or political ideologies, they are assumed to relate to something outside of language, which is more real than the word used to designate it. But to ask what the meaning of life is is to reverse this assumption; it is to assume that life, the ground of our intelligible reality, *refers* to something *within language*. This assumption might be true; it may be, as Jordan Peterson explicitly believes, and many Christians implicitly believe, that what happens in physical reality is an effect of something nonphysical happening elsewhere, in a immaterial, meaning-ful realm. But the assumption in the question decides everything important about the answer; by the time one asks what the meaning of life is, one has already implicitly decided that what happens in reality is a mere reflection of something outside of it.

For now, we can neatly side step the issue of whether existence preceeds essence by asking a different question, which I think is what most people mean when they ask after life's meaning: "what is the *purpose* of life?" This we can answer without immediately confronting the problem of transcendence.

The idea of objects having a purpose is a natural and intuitive one. Even without having seen a hammer in use, if one is acquainted with both the human body and tool use in general, it is very possible one might correctly guess the purpose of a hammer is to drive nails and perform other tasks requiring force applied in a small area. From this inference, it seems natural to assume that all hammers were created for this purpose, and you'd be right in that assumption. Aristotle went so far as to claim that purpose, or "final cause", is one of the four causes which every object has which together bring it into being. Whether that be a human creating the object for their use, or one of the gods creating it to serve some greater or lesser function in the harmonious maintenance of the world, all objects have some purpose with respect to the uses rational beings may put to them.

It's impossible to overstate how important the idea of final cause has been to Western, Christian thought. Evangelicals often claim that their beliefs are derived solely by the divinely inspired Bible, completely ignorant of the many currents running alongside that influence their basic concepts and perceptions. Let's leave aside the mental contortions required to believe not a single letter of a text cobbled together from dozens of sources over 8,000 years has not a single important error; the proliferation of denominations even within Protestantism, many with incompatible interpretations, must lead one to conclude that at minimum, the interpretations themselves constitute social knowledge which is outside the text, and proclaimed ignorance of the influence of ideas which do not originate in the sole authorized text does not make them disappear<sup><a id="foot2" href="#cite2">2</a></sup>. The Evangelical of today would be well served by knowing they owe far more to St. Augustine, a medieval scholar who synthesized Christianity with the then-newly-rediscovered Greek philosophical tradition, than they do to, say, Elijah.

Why does final cause matter so much? Why is the concept inextricably bound up with the unbearable sense of lost purpose I felt when I lost my faith in God? To answer this question, I will turn to Spinoza:

> "...All such opinions spring from the notion commonly entertained, that all things in nature act as men themselves act, namely, with an end in view. It is accepted as certain, that God himself directs all things to a definite goal (for it is said that God made all things for man, and man that he might worship him). I will, therefore, consider this opinion, asking first, why it obtains general credence, and why all men are naturally so prone to adopt it? Secondly, I will point out its falsity; and, lastly, I will show how it has given rise to prejudices about good and bad, right and wrong, praise and blame, order and confusion, beauty and ugliness, and the like. However, this is not the place to deduce these misconceptions from the nature of the human mind: it will be sufficient here, if I assume as a starting point, what ought to be universally admitted, namely, that all men are born ignorant of the causes of things, that all have the desire to seek for what is useful to them, and that they are conscious of such desire. Herefrom it follows, first, that men think themselves free inasmuch as they are conscious of their volitions and desires, and never even dream, in their ignorance, of the causes which have disposed them so to wish and desire. Secondly, that men do all things for an end, namely, for that which is useful to them, and which they seek. Thus it comes to pass that they only look for a knowledge of the final causes of events, and when these are learned, they are content, as having no cause for further doubt. If they cannot learn such causes from external sources, they are compelled to turn to considering themselves, and reflecting what end would have induced them personally to bring about the given event, and thus they necessarily judge other natures by their own. Further, as they find in themselves and outside themselves many means which assist them not a little in the search for what is useful, for instance, eyes for seeing, teeth for chewing, herbs and animals for yielding food, the sun for giving light, the sea for breeding fish, &c., they come to look on the whole of nature as a means for obtaining such conveniences. Now as they are aware, that they found these conveniences and did not make them, they think they have cause for believing, that some other being has made them for their use. As they look upon things as means, they cannot believe them to be self—created; but, judging from the means which they are accustomed to prepare for themselves, they are bound to believe in some ruler or rulers of the universe endowed with human freedom, who have arranged and adapted everything for human use. They are bound to estimate the nature of such rulers (having no information on the subject) in accordance with their own nature, and therefore they assert that the gods ordained everything for the use of man, in order to bind man to themselves and obtain from him the highest honor. Hence also it follows, that everyone thought out for himself, according to his abilities, a different way of worshipping God, so that God might love him more than his fellows, and direct the whole course of nature for the satisfaction of his blind cupidity and insatiable avarice. Thus the prejudice developed into superstition, and took deep root in the human mind; and for this reason everyone strove most zealously to understand and explain the final causes of things; but in their endeavor to show that nature does nothing in vain, i.e. nothing which is useless to man, they only seem to have demonstrated that nature, the gods, and men are all mad together. Consider, I pray you, the result: among the many helps of nature they were bound to find some hindrances, such as storms, earthquakes, diseases, &c.: so they declared that such things happen, because the gods are angry at some wrong done to them by men, or at some fault committed in their worship. Experience day by day protested and showed by infinite examples, that good and evil fortunes fall to the lot of pious and impious alike; still they would not abandon their inveterate prejudice, for it was more easy for them to class such contradictions among other unknown things of whose use they were ignorant, and thus to retain their actual and innate condition of ignorance, than to destroy the whole fabric of their reasoning and start afresh. They therefore laid down as an axiom, that God's judgments far transcend human understanding. Such a doctrine might well have sufficed to conceal the truth from the human race for all eternity, if mathematics had not furnished another standard of verity in considering solely the essence and properties of figures without regard to their final causes."<sup><a id="foot3" href="#cite3">3</a></sup>

Spinoza posits a rather straightforward psychological explanation of how humans come to view the purposes to which rational beings put objects as an essential characteristic of all objects. Aristotle elevated spontaneous misconception to a metaphysical law, a law which Christianity, and most secular Westerners, inherit without knowing it; so that it makes sense when seeking the truth of any object, let alone life itself, to ask "what is its purpose?" He goes on to suggest God may not impose such a rule on himself as we, being creatures of purposeful action, project on him<sup><a id="foot4" href="#cite4">4</a></sup>:

> "There is no need to show at length, that nature has no particular goal in view, and that final causes are mere human figments...everything in nature proceeds from a sort of necessity, and with the utmost perfection. However, I will add a few remarks, in order to overthrow this doctrine of a final cause utterly. That which is really a cause it considers as an effect, and vice versâ: it makes that which is by nature first to be last, and that which is highest and most perfect to be most imperfect. Passing over the questions of cause and priority as self—evident, it is plain that the effect is most perfect which is produced immediately by God; the effect which requires for its production several intermediate causes is, in that respect, more imperfect. But if those things which were made immediately by God were made to enable him to attain his end, then the things which come after, for the sake of which the first were made, are necessarily the most excellent of all... this doctrine does away with the perfection of God: for, if God acts for an object, he necessarily desires something which he lacks. Certainly, theologians and metaphysicians draw a distinction between the object of want and the object of assimilation; still they confess that God made all things for the sake of himself, not for the sake of creation. They are unable to point to anything prior to creation, except God himself, as an object for which God should act, and are therefore driven to admit (as they clearly must), that God lacked those things for whose attainment he created means, and further that he desired them."

> "If all things follow from a necessity of the absolutely perfect nature of God, why are there so many imperfections in nature? Such, for instance, as things corrupt to the point of putridity, loathsome deformity, confusion, evil, sin, &c. But these reasoners are, as I have said, easily confuted, for the perfection of things is to be reckoned only from their own nature and power; things are not more or less perfect, according as they delight or offend human senses, or according as they are serviceable or repugnant to mankind. To those who ask why God did not so create all men, that they should be governed only by reason, I give no answer but this: because matter was not lacking to him for the creation of every degree of perfection from highest to lowest; or, more strictly, because the laws of his nature are so vast, as to suffice for the production of everything conceivable by an infinite intelligence."

Spinoza's metaphysics are beautiful, positive, and frightening; his *Deus siva Natura* (God *or* Nature, whichever helps one dispose of anthropic projections on the supreme cause) is joyfully, infinitely powerful, and neither knows nor needs an external purpose or meaning to be what he is; he simply is, and his perfection rests in that infinite "is" for itself, of which we each are a part in our determinate, finite existence. While Spinoza's God is indifferent to human aims, it is not cruely but joyfully so; and I find this hard but joyful world more blessed than a loving God without power, more agreeable than a powerful God without love, and infinitely more true to the evidence of my senses than a God who is both.

But Spinoza is not blind to the difficulty of accepting his way of seeing things. At the end of his ethics, he writes:

> "If the way which I have pointed out as leading to this result seems exceedingly hard, it may nevertheless be discovered. Needs must it be hard, since it is so seldom found. How would it be possible, if salvation were ready to our hand, and could without great labour be found, that it should be by almost all men neglected? But all things excellent are as difficult as they are rare."

All this is not to say that the question of the meaning or purpose of life is not a symptom of a genuine crisis in the modern world. As Spinoza points out, humans cannot help but be purposeful beings, though we suffer inordinately when we mistakenly believe nature herself to be so oriented. But it is unquestionably true that modernity, since the time of Dostoyevski, Nietzsche, and Marx, has struggled unsuccessfully to answer without possible reversal the question "what purpose should we put ourselves to, as individuals and as societies?" So I wanted to begin by circumscribing the crisis properly. When conservatives describe a loss of meaning, I believe that in nearly all cases they mean one of the following:

- A feeling that the purpose of human life has lost its immutable, eternal character. Purpose is now felt to be a part of contested history, and this is intolerable.
- A feeling that the stories which once bound people together (religion, progress, etc.) have lost their power to compel belief.
- An objection to decadent (meaning unsustainable, but also generally hedonist) cultural practices.

All three of these problems are projected onto external enemies of real, ordinary Americans, people who generally know without asking what they want and why. Their enemies are always painted with the same broad brushstrokes, though always with new names:

- Insufferably opaque academics who talk nonsense to feel themselves superior to ordinary people, and who desperately need to indoctrinate the young to prop up their fragile beliefs 
- Ugly, perverse men, deluded into believing they are women, who need to involve children in their perversity to validate their identities
- Muslims who are replacing the white population through affirmative action and free abortions
- The Hollywood media moguls and billionaires, who move the others like pawns on a chessboard, ever closer to their goal of destroying America once and for all

These caricatures are usually denied by conservatives when confronted in all their lurid detail; but one can find countless examples on the seedy underbelly of the internet, where people feel free to play with the full pallete of their anxieties. But as conservatives feel more isolated and threatened, and as the walls between public and private communication crumble, the effort to maintain a public, respectable conservatism falls increasingly behind the ever mounting pressure of its raw, lewd expression.

While I absolutely reject the all-to-easy scapegoating of the weird and marginalized, the crises they are responsive to are absolutely real, and urgently demand wisdom and action from the entire human race. Endlessly, performatively condemning the scapegoating, implicitly denying that anything is wrong other than moral failures on the part of conservatives, does nothing but obscure and reinforce the underlying problems. I'm not here to virtue signal, but to acknowledge with humility how old and how serious the problem is. Because the truly unbearable truth is that the crisis of modernity is by no means a lack of meaning, but a sublime, unholy torrent, always threatening to overwhelm any single human intellect.

# The Right to Ignorance

Anyone who uses the internet to any degree will inevitably find themselves exposed to ideas and practices utterly foreign to themselves, many of which provoke a gut reaction of disgust. Due to a confluence of factors, from the need for capitalist economies to forcibly open trade between cultures, to acceleration in the speed of travel and communication, to the unprecedented collapse of language diversity, people are more connected than ever before. Yet this doesn't necessarily mean we *feel* connected, or that we use that connection to foster understanding and cooperation. At times we experience this perpetual connection as a blessing and delight, and at others as an intolerable burden and nuisance; but for those of a conservative disposition<sup><a id="foot5" href="#cite5">5</a></sup>, it may be experienced more often as provocation than opportunity. This dynamic undoubtedly favors those with either an innate or cultivated appreciation for openness and exchange, but not, as conservatives often imply, because of a conspiracy on the part of a sinister cabal bent on the destruction of everything simple and innocent, but due the basic dynamics of instant communication. At a certain point, having in-depth knowledge of every possible human practice is incompatible with the belief that one's own way form of existence is the only acceptable form. One must either forcibly close the floodgates, or, without realizing it, slide into some sort of cosmopolitanism.

The sort of conservatives who can't help but constantly remind us that they are and want to be a part of the public discourse are then a seeming contradiction. Which is why I see an important distinction between systematic rejections of modernity, like the Amish, and postmodern conservatism, a movement which is thoroughly embedded in and defined by the problems of a modernity it claims to reject. Conservatives claim to be committed to classical enlightenment values like free speech, democracy, the marketplace of ideas, and Reals over Feels. But these values inevitably come into conflict with other conservative values and ideals. In the last several generations, conservative Christianity has been losing share in that marketplace, especially among the young. For conservatives, it cannot be that the message they are putting forward is, on its own merits, unappealing to the majority of people, including their own children. Someone must not be playing fair. To justify this belief, while maintainging some semblance of commitment to free inquiry, they employ totalizing narratives that allow them to scapegoat the situation onto others who have an unfair advantage. Some examples:

- The democratic process is illegitimate and untrustworthy. Democrats are cheating with fake votes, and bribing people who are not Real Americans as we define it; under these circumstances, it is impossible for us to win. Therefore, although we are the real defenders of democracy, we cannot use democracy to win. Since they are not fighting fair, we don't have to either.
- Parents have the absolute right to decide what their children learn and who they associate with. Anyone who attempts to teach children a way of understanding the world their parents do not approve of is abusive. Parents have the absolute right to define what is and isn't abusive as far as their children are concerned.
- In a world with genuine free speech, conservative ideas would be respectable in the public discourse. If conservative ideas are excluded from or not respected in mainstream communication platforms, this cannot be the result of individuals exercising their first amendment right to exclude speech they dislike; it must constitute illegitimate censorship.<sup><a id="foot6" href="#cite6">6</a></sup>
- Most higher education instutions lean liberal. This must be an artificial result of certain individuals in pursuit of power and money. We are committed to capital T Truth, but people who are educated are for the most part corrupted by an outside, motivated influence, therefore education itself is to be viewed with suspicion, unless it is grounded in a commitment to conservative principles.

All these narratives cover over what seems, if you take a longer view than conservatives usually do, to be an inevitable tendency of modernity, and of the classical liberal values that postmodern conservatives claim to be committed to. Modernity is liberalizing. If one enjoys the benefits of free thought and market competition, one also inevitably opens the doors to all sorts of degenerate cosmopolitanism. To seal the breach, one must invent a menagerie of villians out to destroy the Christian way of life for a combination of profit and pure pleasure in destruction. But I would contend that conservatives who participate in modern societies, regardless of their explicit beliefs about God and Nature, are atheists in all the ways that matter.

# What is an atheist?

Freud diagnosed the crisis of modernity as the result of three great blows on Man's naive image of himself:

> "Humanity has in the course of time had to endure from the hands of science two great outrages upon its naive self-love. The first was when it realized that our earth was not the center of the universe, but only a tiny speck in a world-system of a magnitude hardly conceivable; this is associated in our minds with the name of Copernicus, although Alexandrian doctrines taught something very similar. The second was when biological research robbed man of his peculiar privilege of having been specially created, and relegated him to a descent from the animal world, implying an ineradicable animal nature in him: this transvaluation has been accomplished in our own time upon the instigation of Charles Darwin, Wallace, and their predecessors, and not without the most violent opposition from their contemporaries. But man's craving for grandiosity is now suffering the third and most bitter blow from present-day psychological research which is endeavoring to prove to the ego of each one of us that he is not even master in his own house, but that he must remain content with the veriest scraps of information about what is going on unconsciously in his own mind."

Humans, even non-western ones, have long enjoyed the privilege of telling stories about themselves that place them at the center of the cosmos. While this way of looking at things can and does arise spontaneously in many cultures, it is particuarly dogmatic in western thought. The world is the creation of a God with human-like qualities, who made the world in order to place his most special and God-like creation, Man, in charge of it. Originaly, everything, from the highest to the lowest, exists for his use and enjoyment. It was an abberation, a fault, that made it so some things in nature come into conflict with Man's. While Galileo did not originate the theory of heliocentrism, his conflict with the church demonstrates how long-established scientific theories can come into sudden and violent conflict with the way a human culture subconsciously sees itself, and how hard it is to change those subconscious ideas once established, evidence be damned.

I believe one can see modernity as a series of endless repetitions of one of three solutions to the crisis of Man's humiliation by his own inquiry:

## The Evangelical Solution: Denial

![John Clerk of Eldin – Unconformity at Jedburgh, Borders (engraving)](/unconformity.jpg)

Another example of a violent clash between the discoveries of the empirical sciences and society's unconcsous beliefs is the American Evangelical movement's rejection of evolution and an ancient earth. Long before Darwin, it was well established in the sciences that the earth was, at the most conservative estimates, many hundreds of thousands of years old. To some, if the human history we know is only a tiny fraction of the history of life on earth, let alone the universe, it can't help but undermines Man's image of the earth as the stage for God's story through Man. But for many of the people pioneered the discovery of an ancient earth, deep time had a very different meaning, one which spoke to them of the glory and majesty of God.

One early proponent of an ancient earth was James Hutton, who published his masterwork *Theory of the Earth* in 1795, nearly a century before Darwin published *On the Origin of the Species*. Generally considered to be an impenetrable mess, his theories were popularized by his fiend John Playfair, who remarked: "On those of us who saw these phenomena for the first time, the impression made will not easily be forgotten… The mind seemed to grow giddy by looking so far into the abyss of time."

What made such an impression on Hutton and his friends was a geological feature he called an *unconformity*. As Stephen Jay Gould explains in his brilliant and accessible Time’s Arrow, Time’s Cycle, an unconformity is

> “...a fossil surface of erosion, a gap in time separating two episodes in the formation of rocks. Unconformities are direct evidence that the history of our earth includes several cycles of deposition and uplift."

> “I still use Hutton's drawing in my introductory courses to illustrate a principle that continues to stun me with its elegance after twenty annual repetitions—the complex panorama of history that can be inferred from the simple geometry of horizontal above vertical, once you understand the basic rules for deposition of strata. I can list a dozen distinct events that must have occurred to produce this geometry, with Hutton's unconformity as the key."

> "Since large expanses of water-laid strata must be deposited flat (or nearly so), the underlying vertical sequence arose at right angles to its current orientation. These strata were then broken, uplifted, and tilted to vertical in forming land above the ocean's surface. The land eroded, producing the uneven horizontal surface of the unconformity itself. Eventually, the seas rose again (or the land foundered) and waves further planed the old surface, producing a "pudding stone" of pebbles made from the vertical strata. Under the sea again, horizontal strata formed as products of the second cycle. Another period of uplift then raised these rocks above the sea once more, this time not breaking or tilting the strata. (Hutton reminds us that we must infer a second episode of uplift by drawing a meeting of phaeton and solitary horseman above the horizontal set of originally marine strata.) Thus, we see in this simple geometry of horizontal above vertical two great cycles of sedimentation with two episodes of uplift, the first tumultuous, the second more gentle."

Contemplating the enormous expanse of time evidenced by an unconformity fills me with a sense of sublime awe. Hiking in Great Falls, Virginia, walking over layers of rock laid by centuries of slow deposit at the bottom of an ocean, then turned ninety degrees by an unimaginably forceful event, I feel I am in touch with a vastness which is also totally beyond me. Yet it might be easy to mistake this giddiness for a thouroughly modern glee in iconoclasm. Conservative Christians often impcitly depict the struggle between, on the one hand, deep time and evolution, and on the other "creation science", as an ideological struggle between the iconoclasts and the traditionalists. For them, the people behind Man's great dethronements take a certain ilicit pleasure in humbling God and, through Him, Man, and this motiviates their endless quest to destroy every flattering image man ever had of himself. Unquestionably, many have such inclinations, myself included. But for Hutton, the motiviation was quite different. On the contrary, he saw the vastness of time as evidence that the earth had been made by God in specific accord with human nature: “a world contrived in consummate wisdom for the growth and habitation of a great diversity of plants and animals; and a world peculiarly adapted to the purpose of man, who inhabits all its climates, who measures its extent, and determines its productions at his pleasure.”

The history of naturalism from the 17th century up to Darwin is littered with examples of God-fearing men who, despite their explicit commitment to belief in God and unconscious acceptance a anthropocentric world picture, neverless laid the stones that would one day overturn that picture. It was not, first, a conscious desire to challenge God's authority, which then sought empirical justification; the bulk of the empirical evidence was accumulated by people who still carried with them the old picture of human design and destiny, and gradually came to light in spite of this preconception. Only when the evidence had accumulated for centuries did people begin to consciously challenge the unconscous assumptions. Only once evolution had already been cemented in the sciences did the ideological struggle, exemplified by the Scopes Monkey Trial, take precidence.

Over the course of the 20th century, American Evangelicalism took an increasingly hard-line, literalist approach to anything that smelled like evolution and atheism, including the idea of an ancient earth.

But it's difficult for moderns to fully escape the anxieties engendered by Man's dethronement via conscious denial. The fault runs so deep through the modern mind that it's almost impossible to fully, unconsciously believe in Man's centrality. But without an alternative mythology, most if not all of us rarely fully believe in Man's dethronement either. In his book *Full House*, *Stephen Jay Gould* demonstrates how the idea of Man as the end to which all of natural history leads slips into our common understanding of natural history:

> "My favorite example of unrecognized bias in depicting the history of life resides quite literally in the prictures we paint. We all know these series of paintings– from a first scene of trilobites in the Cambrian sea, through lots of dinosaurs in the middle, to a last picture of Cro-Magnon ancestors busy decorating a cave in France. We have viewed these sequences on the walls of natural history museums, and in coffee-table books about the history of life. Now what cound be wrong about such a series? Trilobites did dominate the first faunas of multicellular organisms; humans did arise only yesterday; and dinosaurs did flourish in between. So why am I complaining?"

> "The paintings are 'right' in a narrow sense. But nothing can be more misleading than formally correct but limited information drastically yanked out of context. (Remember the old story about the captain who disliked his first mate and recorded in the ship's log, after a unique episode, "First mate was drunk today." The mate begged the captain to remove the passage, stating correctly that this had never happened before and that his employment would be jeopardized. The captain refused. The mate kept the next day's log, and he recorded, "Captain was sober today.")

> "As for this nautical tale, so for the history of life. All the prominent paintings in this genre of prehistoric art claim to be portraying the nub or essence of life's history through time. They all begin with a scene or two of Paleozoic invertibrates. We note our first bias even here, for the prevertibrate seas span nearly half the history of multicellular animal life, yet never commandeer more than 10 percent of the pictures. As soon as fishes begin to prosper in the Devonian perido, underwater scenes switch to these first vertebrates–and we never see another invertebrate again for all the rest of the pageant. Even the fishes get short shrift, for not a single one ever appears again (except as fleeing prey for a an ichthyosaur or a mosauar) after the emergence of the terrestiral vertebrate life toward the end of the Paleozoic era...Invertibates didn't die or stop evolving after fishes appeared; much of their most important history unrolls in contemporaneous partnership with marine vertebrates...Similarly, fishes didn't die out or stop evolving just because one lineage of peripheral brethren managed to colonize the land."

> "Let me not carp unfairly. If these pageantries only claimed to be illustrating the ancestry of our tiny human twig on life's tree, then I would not complain, for I cannot quarrel unduly with such a parochial decision, stated up front. But these iconographic sequences always purport to be illustrating *the* history of life, not a tale of a twig...Much as we may love ourselves, *Homo sapiens* is not representative, or symbolic, of life as a whole. We are not surrogates for arthropods (more than 80% of animal species), or exemplars of anything either particular or typical. We are the possessors of one extraordinary evolutionary investment called consciousness–the factor that permits us, rather than any other species, to ruminate about such matters (or, rather, cows ruminate and we cogitate). But how can this invention be viewed as the distillation of life's primary thrust or direction when 80 percent of multicellularity enjoys such evolutionary success and displays no trend to neuroloical complexity through time–and when our own neural elaboration may just as well end up destroying us as sparking a move to any other state that we would choose to designate as 'higher'?"

In light of our new (compared to the long history of Homo sapiens) self-understanding, Gould suggests we "trade the traditional source of human solace in separation for a more interesting view of life in union with other createures as one contingent element of a much larger history. We must give up a cconventional notion of human domination, but we learn to cherish particulars, of which we are but one, and to revel in the complete ranges, to which we contriute one precious point–a good swap, I would argue, of stale (and false) comfort for broader understanding. It is, indeed, a wonderful life within the full house of our planet's history of organic diversity."

Contrast the atheism of Gould with that of Stephen Pinker or Richard Dawkins, who explicitly deny the existence of God, but still implicitly speak as if the Great Commission were in effect. Theirs is another answer to the problem of how to deal with the death of God:

## The Humanist Solution: Ignore It

> Between believers and non-believers, there is only a razor's edge; on both sides of the razor, the abyss of willful ignorance.

From the ashes of God's demise, a simple solution rises: put Man in his place. Instead of the Natural and the Good being given to Man by God, the Natural and the Good will be given by Man to himself, in accordance with his own nature. This is the thrust of many currents of enlightenment rationalism, including my own dear Spinoza. This much Christian conservatives percieve and decry. What they react to is the audacity of Man determining his own ends. How, given Man's falibility, his depravity, how dimly he sees, can he determine his own ends? And indeed, the history of modernity is the history of Man trying and failing to legislate itself. But what conservatives fail to see is that the Secular Humanists are but the other side of the coin of Christianity. As Nietzsche demonstrates, the death of God is Man's retroactive realization that he was always, in reality, legislating himself, whether he does so consciously and in his own name, or whether he attributes Nature to a separate being in Man's image called God. Through God, man makes the world in the image of himself. Whether believer or atheist, the thing that matters is whether one still sees the world in God/Man's image. Both flatter Man's vanity, irrespective of one's inclination toward perfectibility or fallibility.<sup><a id="foot7" href="#cite7">7</a></sup>

I don't personally know how Dawkins and Pinker maintain their optimism at the prospect of self-creating man, but I do not share it. However, true things are true whether or not they make your life more difficult. No doubt it is, in some senses, easier to believe that meaning and purpose are self-evident and eternal. No doubt it is easier to have certainty of what is and isn't natural, from a source that cannot be questioned. But I have no choice to embark on the terrible adventure of becoming worthy of the murder of God, a murder I fell into much as Adam and Eve fell into sin, a deed done before it was possible for them to comprehend its meaning. As I've come to understand it, the history of human life is comprised of a series of falls into seemingly insoluble problems. Maybe only a God can save us. But nothing could convince me to settle for a simulacra god, half-believed out of fear of what might happen if we consciously take the reigns that have been in our hands all along.

## The Post Humanist Solution: Change our subconscious idea of ourselves

While it should be obvious by now this is the solution I prefer, I confess it is nearly impossible. Subconscious models of the world don't need to be true to motivate behavior, and they don't necessarily respond to reasoning. At times, it feels like the modern world is implicitly atheist; whether one believes in God or not, most moderns, including conservatives, don't take seriously the idea that Humans are the center of the world. But at other times, it feels like the old model of Man as the apex of the natural world is alive, well, and consciously believed by most people. Modernity is in large part defined by this double vision, this inability to lock in a clear idea of our relationship to the world and its meaning.

This problem, the problem of modernity, is rather an old one. Nietzsche and his contemporaries attempted to go beyond it well before evolution became the generally accepted theory of the origin of life. What defines *post*modernity, for thinkers like Jean Francious Lyotard, is not just our inability to believe in the centrality of man, but in any coherent, unifying theory of reality at all:

> "Science has always been in conflict with narratives. Judged by the yardstick of science, the majority of them prove to be fables. But to the extent that science does not restrict itself to stating useful regularities and seeks the truth, it is obliged to legitimate the rules of its own game. It then produces a discourse of legitimation with respect to its own status, a discourse called philosophy. I will use the term *modern* to designate any science that legitimates itself with reference to a metadiscourse of this kind making an explicit appeal to some grand narrative, such as the dialectics of Spirit, the hermeneutics of meaning, the emancipation of the rational or working subject, or the creation of wealth. For example, the rule of consensus between the sender and addressee of a statement with truth-value is deemed acceptable if it is cast in terms of a possible unanimity between rational minds: this is the Enlightenment narrative, in which the hero of knowledge works toward a good ethico-political end–universal peace. As can be seen from this example, if a metanarrative implying a philosophy of history is used to legitimate knowledge, questions are raised concerning the validity of the institutions governing the social bond: these must be legitimated as well. Thus justice is consigned to the grand narrative in the same way as truth."

> "Simplifying to the extreme, I define postmodem as incredulity toward metanarratives. This incredulity is undoubtedly a product of progress in the sciences: but that progress in turn presupposes it. To the obsolescence of the metanarrative apparatus of legitimation corresponds; most notably, the crisis of metaphysical philosophy and of the university institution which in the past relied on it. The narrative function is losing it functors, its great hero, its great dangers, its great voyages, its great goal. It is being dispersed in clouds of narrative language elements–narrative, but also denotative, prescriptive, descriptive, and so on. Conveyed within each cloud are pragmatic valencies specific to its kind. Each of us lives at the intersection of many of these. However, we do not necessarily establish stable language combinations, and the properties of the ones we do establish are not necessarily communicable."

> "Thus the society of the future falls less within the province of a Newtonian anthropology (such as stucturalism or systems theory) than a pragmatics of language particles. There are many different language games-a heterogeneity of elements. They only give rise to institutions in patches-local determinism."

> "The decision makers, however, attempt to manage these clouds of sociality according to input/output matrices, following a logic which implies that their elements are commensurable and that the whole is determinable. They allocate our lives for the growth of power. In matters of social justice and of scientific truth alike, the legitimation I of that power is based on its optimizing the system's performance–efficiency. The application of this criterion to all of our games necessarily entails a certain level of terror, whether soft or hard: be operational (that is, commensurable) or disappear. The logic of maximum performance is no doubt inconsistent in many ways, particularly with respect to contradiction in the socio-economic field: it demands both less work (to lower production costs) and more (to lessen the social burden of the idle population). But our incredulity is now such that we no longer expect salvation to rise from these inconsistencies, as did Marx."

Since the collapse of the Soviet Union and the defeat of communism, we passed from a time when alternative metanarratives competed to define the meaning of history, to an era in which no one *really* believes history has a meaning. Those who do seem almost comically credulous and out of touch (irony and cringe culture.) We spend more time arguing and telling stories than ever, but none of them seem to take hold of us, and we need more of them than ever. It is in this sense that I talk about "postmodern" conservatism; it fixates on Culture Wars, lacks any positive or coherent political program, and the only sense in which it attempts to tell a totalizing story is negatively through the creation of relentless, external enemies. But it is not just conservatism; our politics seem dominated by this frenzied statis, all the more metastable the more it keeps us in a state of constant excitation and exhaustion.

How to overcome to this impasse? Can we can *will* ourselves back into believing in a lost totality? Perhaps the constant demand to restore a common language, a common *sense* is *itself* part of how the system reinforces itself. Lyotard, far from being against postmodernity, points out the "severe reexamination which postmodernity imposes on the thought of the Enlightenment, on the idea of a unitary end of history and of a subject", an "illusion" which can only be maintained through "terror". "The nineteenth and twentieth centuries have given us as much terror as we can take. We have paid a high enough price for the nostalgia of the whole and the one, for the reconciliation of the concept and the sensible, of the transparent and the communicable experience. Under the general demand for slackening and for appeasement, we can hear the mutterings of the desire for a return of terror, for the realization of the fantasy to seize reality. The answer is: Let us wage a war on totality; let us be witness to the unpresentable; let us activate the differences and save the honor of the name."

To not give into the temptation to let a fantasy seize realtity is, as near as I can formulate it, the essence of anti-nihilism. All this thinking and speaking and acting and analysing and buying and selling and yet the engine of capital churns on, grinding every human practice and belief into a salable commodity, tuning our every thought and reaction up to a codeable, manageable fever pitch. "A long twilight that bleeds out to the edges of time where even the most fantastic things become banal." Who knows where it will end? If nothing else, be kind.

<a id="cite2" href="#foot2">2.</a> Fundamentalist minister Vernon C. Lyons writes in his ludicrous essay [Why Baptists Are Not Protestants](https://acbc.ie/resources/PDF%27s-&-Files/Why-Baptists-are-not-Protestants.pdf): "Baptists make no effort to trace a historical succession back to the age of the Apostles. Their only claim is that at every age in church history there have been groups that have held to the same doctrines that Baptists hold today... [by contrast,] the Protestant groups look to some human being as their founder, often even taking their name from a man. The Lutherans arise with Luther. The Reformed look to John Calvin. The Presbyterians were founded by John Knox. The Methodists openly acknowledge John Wesley as their founder. Who founded the Baptist churches? Here is a historical question worthy of serious investigation [by who? Surely not Baptists??]. It is impossible [!!] to find any one man who gave rise to Baptist churches. Rather, if we would name human founders, we must look back to Peter, Paul, James and John." This ahistorical assertion is a time honored tradition among sectarian Protestants; what has any Protestant denomination ever said about itself, but that it is, at long last, a return to the scriptures?

<a id="cite4" href="#foot4">4.</a> Throughout this section, I use he/him pronouns to refer to the *Deus siva Natura* described by Spinoza, in conformity with his own style. I made this choice because I feel, as no doubt Spinoza did also, that they would make his concepts more digestible to people used to speaking of God in anthropomorphic terms. I want to be clear however, that I don't think it makes any sense to attribute such human traits as gender to the supreme cause.

<a id="cite5" href="#foot5">5.</a> It is common knowledge at this point that conservative and liberal as dispositions have a biological basis; how sensitive a person is to the physical sensation of disgust is highly predictive of their political beliefs. Beyond the basic acceptance that this link exists however, one must be exceedingly careful not reductively assume that conservatism as a political movement is comprised of the anal-retentive individuals, while liberalism captures the diarrhetic; many if not most liberals I've encountered have shockingly weak stomachs for novelty. Not that this implies the reverse is more than rarely true, as self-identified conservatives cannot without hypocrisy avow a taste for the new.

<a id="cite6" href="#foot6">6.</a> For the record, I think that the monopoly of capital over the means of communication is absolutely a crisis which demands immediate action. But if we're being consistent, part of free speech in market liberalism is that, if you own a platform, you have the right to exclude speech you don't like, for any reason. Conservatives were fine with this dynamic when conservative ideas garnered more respect in the mainstream; now that capital has in many cases gone Woke, they find this feature of market liberalism unacceptable.

<a id="cite7" href="#foot7">7.</a>  This is what Freud calls the "narcissism of minor differences". People who's ideas and assumptions are ultimately very similar to us, except for their answer to one or two questions, appear to be more different than us than people who's concepts are so foreign, they fail to agitate us. This is easy to spot in others once you have the concept, but hard to apply to yourself.
rowing up in evangelical churches, I was warned time and again that the belief in and worship of God was the cornerstone holding the universe together. Without the certain knowledge of God in my heart, all the world would seem a cacophonous confusion of suffering and death, an endless series of mechanical spasms shoving each other through infinite space and time; in short, nihilism. And indeed, from when I began to lose my faith as a pre teen, up into my 20s, that's exactly how the world felt to me. An intolerable, unredeemed place which lacked even the capacity for redemption. But sadly, the fact that the prophecy came true was of no help to me. Because conviction, whether we possess it or lack it, by definition is that part of us which cannot submit to what is psychologically or socially beneficial. I would have given anything to believe in an all loving and all powerful God, to put an end to the torment I inflicted on myself and the bitterness I harbored against the world. But my unfaith would not yield to what I so desperately wanted to be true. No wishing or pleading could wipe away the simple truth carved into on my heart: "Rain falls on the good and the bad alike; an unjust world cannot be the product of an all-loving and all-powerful God; he is either indifferent to human affairs, or he does not exist."

While my core belief about the world, namely that there is no final guarantor of justice, has not changed, I've always found the equation of this belief with nihilism to be irritating. Conservative public figures like Jordan Peterson often diagnose modern society as nihilistic, drawing heavily on thinkers like Friedrich Nietzsche and Fyodor Dostoyevski. But my primary motivating ethic, the very thing that makes belief in God impossible for Nietzsche, myself, and I suspect also for Peterson, is precisely a rejection of nihilism. If the evidence suggests that we cannot justifiably believe in God, a fixed human nature, or other beliefs which have unquestionably been of use to human societies, we cannot *make* ourselves believe them simply because it is beneficial to do so. In the words of Martin Heidegger, an atheist with all the fear and trembling of the devout:

> Only a god can still save us. I think the only possibility of salvation left to us is to prepare readiness, through thinking and poetry, for the appearance of the god or for the absence of the god during the decline; so that we do not, simply put, die meaningless deaths, but that when we decline, we decline in the face of the absent god.<sup><a id="foot1" href="#cite1">1</a></sup>

In other words, even if you believe a world without God is intolerable, unstable, and unsustainable, better to decline in truth than to prosper in a lie. The conditions of modernity have conspired to make it so no one who is dependent on the modern societies for their survival can totally escape the dangerous spirit of questioning. In order to resolve this anxiety, conservatives finds scapegoats; it is not you who feels uncertain in the face of an overwhelming torrent of possible beliefs about the world, it is Critical Race Theorists, Post-Modern Neo-Marxists, and Gender Ideologues who are producing dangerous, motivated ideas to attack and pervert your correct, self-evident, eternal way of seeing the world. It is not that your beliefs are difficult to maintain in a world of instantaneous communication and unprecedented growth of the natural sciences; the problem is that they are under attack by people who are not fighting fair, people who fear and resent your beliefs.

But there is something contradictory about this narrative. If the scapegoating accounts of nihilism in conservative media were right, conservatives would have nothing to fear from progressives; after all, they have meaning and purpose, founded in self evident and unshakable faith; what could godless, decadent liberal elites offer to compete with such assurance? Why do children need to be protected, through censorship and withdrawal from public life, from ideas which are transparently empty and unsatisfying? And yet churches, along with every other institution of collective life, continue to hemorrhage membership. Those that remain resort to increasingly illiberal means to maintain themselves and their children in their beliefs, and become increasingly violent towards anyone who threatens those beliefs. Just as something feels unmistakably weak and unmanly about someone who constantly talks about masculinity, the conservative fixation on nihilism carries a whiff of confession. The truth is that there *is* an ongoing crisis of meaning in modernity, which *no one has thus far been able to once and for all surmount*; though many have lived beautiful lives, made magnificent works, and deepened the hues of the problem, precisely by refusing to displace it onto easy scapegoats. In the face of such difficulty, the only truly nihilistic thing to do is to shut one's eyes, stop one's ears, and pretend to a certainty which one cannot justifiably posses.

With that in mind, I'd like to trace the contours of the crisis of meaning, through the lens of of how American Evangelicals, Conservatives, and the various currents that mix therein, talk about it. I'll start with a brief discussion of the origin of the western conception of meaning and purpose; next, I hope to clarify what I believe conservatives mean when they attribute to modernity a crisis of meaning; I'll then sketch a rough picture of how I think nihilism ought rightly to be understood; and lastly, I'll explore how Evangelicals' intentional distortion of natural history, a natural history pioneered almost exclusively by devout Christian ministers, is itself the height of nihilism.

# Meaning and Purpose

![Life is meaningless / life is unbearably meaningful / ayyy lmao](/meaningful.jpg)

"What is the meaning of life?" seems at first glance like a simple, obvious question, which any philosopher worth the name ought to be able to answer. But the question itself neatly hides all sorts of metaphysical assumptions which have to be first unpacked before the question can even be posed. For example, "meaning" is a feature of language; words generally to refer to an something happening in this thing we call reality. For example, the word "tree" refers to the set of objects which have roots, hard bark-covered trunks, branches, and leaves. Even when words refer to something abstract, like countries or political ideologies, they are assumed to relate to something outside of language, which is more real than the word used to designate it. But to ask what the meaning of life is is to reverse this assumption; it is to assume that life, the ground of our intelligible reality, *refers* to something *within language*. This assumption might be true; it may be, as Jordan Peterson explicitly believes, and many Christians implicitly believe, that what happens in physical reality is an effect of something nonphysical happening elsewhere, in a immaterial, meaning-ful realm. But the assumption in the question decides everything important about the answer; by the time one asks what the meaning of life is, one has already implicitly decided that what happens in reality is a mere reflection of something outside of it.

For now, we can neatly side step the issue of whether existence preceeds essence by asking a different question, which I think is what most people mean when they ask after life's meaning: "what is the *purpose* of life?" This we can answer without immediately confronting the problem of transcendence.

The idea of objects having a purpose is a natural and intuitive one. Even without having seen a hammer in use, if one is acquainted with both the human body and tool use in general, it is very possible one might correctly guess the purpose of a hammer is to drive nails and perform other tasks requiring force applied in a small area. From this inference, it seems natural to assume that all hammers were created for this purpose, and you'd be right in that assumption. Aristotle went so far as to claim that purpose, or "final cause", is one of the four causes which every object has which together bring it into being. Whether that be a human creating the object for their use, or one of the gods creating it to serve some greater or lesser function in the harmonious maintenance of the world, all objects have some purpose with respect to the uses rational beings may put to them.

It's impossible to overstate how important the idea of final cause has been to Western, Christian thought. Evangelicals often claim that their beliefs are derived solely by the divinely inspired Bible, completely ignorant of the many currents running alongside that influence their basic concepts and perceptions. Let's leave aside the mental contortions required to believe not a single letter of a text cobbled together from dozens of sources over 8,000 years has not a single important error; the proliferation of denominations even within Protestantism, many with incompatible interpretations, must lead one to conclude that at minimum, the interpretations themselves constitute social knowledge which is outside the text, and proclaimed ignorance of the influence of ideas which do not originate in the sole authorized text does not make them disappear<sup><a id="foot2" href="#cite2">2</a></sup>. The Evangelical of today would be well served by knowing they owe far more to St. Augustine, a medieval scholar who synthesized Christianity with the then-newly-rediscovered Greek philosophical tradition, than they do to, say, Elijah.

Why does final cause matter so much? Why is the concept inextricably bound up with the unbearable sense of lost purpose I felt when I lost my faith in God? To answer this question, I will turn to Spinoza:

> "...All such opinions spring from the notion commonly entertained, that all things in nature act as men themselves act, namely, with an end in view. It is accepted as certain, that God himself directs all things to a definite goal (for it is said that God made all things for man, and man that he might worship him). I will, therefore, consider this opinion, asking first, why it obtains general credence, and why all men are naturally so prone to adopt it? Secondly, I will point out its falsity; and, lastly, I will show how it has given rise to prejudices about good and bad, right and wrong, praise and blame, order and confusion, beauty and ugliness, and the like. However, this is not the place to deduce these misconceptions from the nature of the human mind: it will be sufficient here, if I assume as a starting point, what ought to be universally admitted, namely, that all men are born ignorant of the causes of things, that all have the desire to seek for what is useful to them, and that they are conscious of such desire. Herefrom it follows, first, that men think themselves free inasmuch as they are conscious of their volitions and desires, and never even dream, in their ignorance, of the causes which have disposed them so to wish and desire. Secondly, that men do all things for an end, namely, for that which is useful to them, and which they seek. Thus it comes to pass that they only look for a knowledge of the final causes of events, and when these are learned, they are content, as having no cause for further doubt. If they cannot learn such causes from external sources, they are compelled to turn to considering themselves, and reflecting what end would have induced them personally to bring about the given event, and thus they necessarily judge other natures by their own. Further, as they find in themselves and outside themselves many means which assist them not a little in the search for what is useful, for instance, eyes for seeing, teeth for chewing, herbs and animals for yielding food, the sun for giving light, the sea for breeding fish, &c., they come to look on the whole of nature as a means for obtaining such conveniences. Now as they are aware, that they found these conveniences and did not make them, they think they have cause for believing, that some other being has made them for their use. As they look upon things as means, they cannot believe them to be self—created; but, judging from the means which they are accustomed to prepare for themselves, they are bound to believe in some ruler or rulers of the universe endowed with human freedom, who have arranged and adapted everything for human use. They are bound to estimate the nature of such rulers (having no information on the subject) in accordance with their own nature, and therefore they assert that the gods ordained everything for the use of man, in order to bind man to themselves and obtain from him the highest honor. Hence also it follows, that everyone thought out for himself, according to his abilities, a different way of worshipping God, so that God might love him more than his fellows, and direct the whole course of nature for the satisfaction of his blind cupidity and insatiable avarice. Thus the prejudice developed into superstition, and took deep root in the human mind; and for this reason everyone strove most zealously to understand and explain the final causes of things; but in their endeavor to show that nature does nothing in vain, i.e. nothing which is useless to man, they only seem to have demonstrated that nature, the gods, and men are all mad together. Consider, I pray you, the result: among the many helps of nature they were bound to find some hindrances, such as storms, earthquakes, diseases, &c.: so they declared that such things happen, because the gods are angry at some wrong done to them by men, or at some fault committed in their worship. Experience day by day protested and showed by infinite examples, that good and evil fortunes fall to the lot of pious and impious alike; still they would not abandon their inveterate prejudice, for it was more easy for them to class such contradictions among other unknown things of whose use they were ignorant, and thus to retain their actual and innate condition of ignorance, than to destroy the whole fabric of their reasoning and start afresh. They therefore laid down as an axiom, that God's judgments far transcend human understanding. Such a doctrine might well have sufficed to conceal the truth from the human race for all eternity, if mathematics had not furnished another standard of verity in considering solely the essence and properties of figures without regard to their final causes."<sup><a id="foot3" href="#cite3">3</a></sup>

Spinoza posits a rather straightforward psychological explanation of how humans come to view the purposes to which rational beings put objects as an essential characteristic of all objects. Aristotle elevated spontaneous misconception to a metaphysical law, a law which Christianity, and most secular Westerners, inherit without knowing it; so that it makes sense when seeking the truth of any object, let alone life itself, to ask "what is its purpose?" He goes on to suggest God may not impose such a rule on himself as we, being creatures of purposeful action, project on him<sup><a id="foot4" href="#cite4">4</a></sup>:

> "There is no need to show at length, that nature has no particular goal in view, and that final causes are mere human figments...everything in nature proceeds from a sort of necessity, and with the utmost perfection. However, I will add a few remarks, in order to overthrow this doctrine of a final cause utterly. That which is really a cause it considers as an effect, and vice versâ: it makes that which is by nature first to be last, and that which is highest and most perfect to be most imperfect. Passing over the questions of cause and priority as self—evident, it is plain that the effect is most perfect which is produced immediately by God; the effect which requires for its production several intermediate causes is, in that respect, more imperfect. But if those things which were made immediately by God were made to enable him to attain his end, then the things which come after, for the sake of which the first were made, are necessarily the most excellent of all... this doctrine does away with the perfection of God: for, if God acts for an object, he necessarily desires something which he lacks. Certainly, theologians and metaphysicians draw a distinction between the object of want and the object of assimilation; still they confess that God made all things for the sake of himself, not for the sake of creation. They are unable to point to anything prior to creation, except God himself, as an object for which God should act, and are therefore driven to admit (as they clearly must), that God lacked those things for whose attainment he created means, and further that he desired them."

> "If all things follow from a necessity of the absolutely perfect nature of God, why are there so many imperfections in nature? Such, for instance, as things corrupt to the point of putridity, loathsome deformity, confusion, evil, sin, &c. But these reasoners are, as I have said, easily confuted, for the perfection of things is to be reckoned only from their own nature and power; things are not more or less perfect, according as they delight or offend human senses, or according as they are serviceable or repugnant to mankind. To those who ask why God did not so create all men, that they should be governed only by reason, I give no answer but this: because matter was not lacking to him for the creation of every degree of perfection from highest to lowest; or, more strictly, because the laws of his nature are so vast, as to suffice for the production of everything conceivable by an infinite intelligence."

Spinoza's metaphysics are beautiful, positive, and frightening; his *Deus siva Natura* (God *or* Nature, whichever helps one dispose of anthropic projections on the supreme cause) is joyfully, infinitely powerful, and neither knows nor needs an external purpose or meaning to be what he is; he simply is, and his perfection rests in that infinite "is" for itself, of which we each are a part in our determinate, finite existence. While Spinoza's God is indifferent to human aims, it is not cruely but joyfully so; and I find this hard but joyful world more blessed than a loving God without power, more agreeable than a powerful God without love, and infinitely more true to the evidence of my senses than a God who is both.

But Spinoza is not blind to the difficulty of accepting his way of seeing things. At the end of his ethics, he writes:

> "If the way which I have pointed out as leading to this result seems exceedingly hard, it may nevertheless be discovered. Needs must it be hard, since it is so seldom found. How would it be possible, if salvation were ready to our hand, and could without great labour be found, that it should be by almost all men neglected? But all things excellent are as difficult as they are rare."

All this is not to say that the question of the meaning or purpose of life is not a symptom of a genuine crisis in the modern world. As Spinoza points out, humans cannot help but be purposeful beings, though we suffer inordinately when we mistakenly believe nature herself to be so oriented. But it is unquestionably true that modernity, since the time of Dostoyevski, Nietzsche, and Marx, has struggled unsuccessfully to answer without possible reversal the question "what purpose should we put ourselves to, as individuals and as societies?" So I wanted to begin by circumscribing the crisis properly. When conservatives describe a loss of meaning, I believe that in nearly all cases they mean one of the following:

- A feeling that the purpose of human life has lost its immutable, eternal character. Purpose is now felt to be a part of contested history, and this is intolerable.
- A feeling that the stories which once bound people together (religion, progress, etc.) have lost their power to compel belief.
- An objection to decadent (meaning unsustainable, but also generally hedonist) cultural practices.

All three of these problems are projected onto external enemies of real, ordinary Americans, people who generally know without asking what they want and why. Their enemies are always painted with the same broad brushstrokes, though always with new names:

- Insufferably opaque academics who talk nonsense to feel themselves superior to ordinary people, and who desperately need to indoctrinate the young to prop up their fragile beliefs 
- Ugly, perverse men, deluded into believing they are women, who need to involve children in their perversity to validate their identities
- Muslims who are replacing the white population through affirmative action and free abortions
- The Hollywood media moguls and billionaires, who move the others like pawns on a chessboard, ever closer to their goal of destroying America once and for all

These caricatures are usually denied by conservatives when confronted in all their lurid detail; but one can find countless examples on the seedy underbelly of the internet, where people feel free to play with the full pallete of their anxieties. But as conservatives feel more isolated and threatened, and as the walls between public and private communication crumble, the effort to maintain a public, respectable conservatism falls increasingly behind the ever mounting pressure of its raw, lewd expression.

While I absolutely reject the all-to-easy scapegoating of the weird and marginalized, the crises they are responsive to are absolutely real, and urgently demand wisdom and action from the entire human race. Endlessly, performatively condemning the scapegoating, implicitly denying that anything is wrong other than moral failures on the part of conservatives, does nothing but obscure and reinforce the underlying problems. I'm not here to virtue signal, but to acknowledge with humility how old and how serious the problem is. Because the truly unbearable truth is that the crisis of modernity is by no means a lack of meaning, but a sublime, unholy torrent, always threatening to overwhelm any single human intellect.

# The Right to Ignorance

Anyone who uses the internet to any degree will inevitably find themselves exposed to ideas and practices utterly foreign to themselves, many of which provoke a gut reaction of disgust. Due to a confluence of factors, from the need for capitalist economies to forcibly open trade between cultures, to acceleration in the speed of travel and communication, to the unprecedented collapse of language diversity, people are more connected than ever before. Yet this doesn't necessarily mean we *feel* connected, or that we use that connection to foster understanding and cooperation. At times we experience this perpetual connection as a blessing and delight, and at others as an intolerable burden and nuisance; but for those of a conservative disposition<sup><a id="foot5" href="#cite5">5</a></sup>, it may be experienced more often as provocation than opportunity. This dynamic undoubtedly favors those with either an innate or cultivated appreciation for openness and exchange, but not, as conservatives often imply, because of a conspiracy on the part of a sinister cabal bent on the destruction of everything simple and innocent, but due the basic dynamics of instant communication. At a certain point, having in-depth knowledge of every possible human practice is incompatible with the belief that one's own way form of existence is the only acceptable form. One must either forcibly close the floodgates, or, without realizing it, slide into some sort of cosmopolitanism.

The sort of conservatives who can't help but constantly remind us that they are and want to be a part of the public discourse are then a seeming contradiction. Which is why I see an important distinction between systematic rejections of modernity, like the Amish, and postmodern conservatism, a movement which is thoroughly embedded in and defined by the problems of a modernity it claims to reject. Conservatives claim to be committed to classical enlightenment values like free speech, democracy, the marketplace of ideas, and Reals over Feels. But these values inevitably come into conflict with other conservative values and ideals. In the last several generations, conservative Christianity has been losing share in that marketplace, especially among the young. For conservatives, it cannot be that the message they are putting forward is, on its own merits, unappealing to the majority of people, including their own children. Someone must not be playing fair. To justify this belief, while maintainging some semblance of commitment to free inquiry, they employ totalizing narratives that allow them to scapegoat the situation onto others who have an unfair advantage. Some examples:

- The democratic process is illegitimate and untrustworthy. Democrats are cheating with fake votes, and bribing people who are not Real Americans as we define it; under these circumstances, it is impossible for us to win. Therefore, although we are the real defenders of democracy, we cannot use democracy to win. Since they are not fighting fair, we don't have to either.
- Parents have the absolute right to decide what their children learn and who they associate with. Anyone who attempts to teach children a way of understanding the world their parents do not approve of is abusive. Parents have the absolute right to define what is and isn't abusive as far as their children are concerned.
- In a world with genuine free speech, conservative ideas would be respectable in the public discourse. If conservative ideas are excluded from or not respected in mainstream communication platforms, this cannot be the result of individuals exercising their first amendment right to exclude speech they dislike; it must constitute illegitimate censorship.<sup><a id="foot6" href="#cite6">6</a></sup>
- Most higher education instutions lean liberal. This must be an artificial result of certain individuals in pursuit of power and money. We are committed to capital T Truth, but people who are educated are for the most part corrupted by an outside, motivated influence, therefore education itself is to be viewed with suspicion, unless it is grounded in a commitment to conservative principles.

All these narratives cover over what seems, if you take a longer view than conservatives usually do, to be an inevitable tendency of modernity, and of the classical liberal values that postmodern conservatives claim to be committed to. Modernity is liberalizing. If one enjoys the benefits of free thought and market competition, one also inevitably opens the doors to all sorts of degenerate cosmopolitanism. To seal the breach, one must invent a menagerie of villians out to destroy the Christian way of life for a combination of profit and pure pleasure in destruction. But I would contend that conservatives who participate in modern societies, regardless of their explicit beliefs about God and Nature, are atheists in all the ways that matter.

# What is an atheist?

Freud diagnosed the crisis of modernity as the result of three great blows on Man's naive image of himself:

> "Humanity has in the course of time had to endure from the hands of science two great outrages upon its naive self-love. The first was when it realized that our earth was not the center of the universe, but only a tiny speck in a world-system of a magnitude hardly conceivable; this is associated in our minds with the name of Copernicus, although Alexandrian doctrines taught something very similar. The second was when biological research robbed man of his peculiar privilege of having been specially created, and relegated him to a descent from the animal world, implying an ineradicable animal nature in him: this transvaluation has been accomplished in our own time upon the instigation of Charles Darwin, Wallace, and their predecessors, and not without the most violent opposition from their contemporaries. But man's craving for grandiosity is now suffering the third and most bitter blow from present-day psychological research which is endeavoring to prove to the ego of each one of us that he is not even master in his own house, but that he must remain content with the veriest scraps of information about what is going on unconsciously in his own mind."

Humans, even non-western ones, have long enjoyed the privilege of telling stories about themselves that place them at the center of the cosmos. While this way of looking at things can and does arise spontaneously in many cultures, it is particuarly dogmatic in western thought. The world is the creation of a God with human-like qualities, who made the world in order to place his most special and God-like creation, Man, in charge of it. Originaly, everything, from the highest to the lowest, exists for his use and enjoyment. It was an abberation, a fault, that made it so some things in nature come into conflict with Man's. While Galileo did not originate the theory of heliocentrism, his conflict with the church demonstrates how long-established scientific theories can come into sudden and violent conflict with the way a human culture subconsciously sees itself, and how hard it is to change those subconscious ideas once established, evidence be damned.

I believe one can see modernity as a series of endless repetitions of one of three solutions to the crisis of Man's humiliation by his own inquiry:

## The Evangelical Solution: Denial

![John Clerk of Eldin – Unconformity at Jedburgh, Borders (engraving)](/unconformity.jpg)

Another example of a violent clash between the discoveries of the empirical sciences and society's unconcsous beliefs is the American Evangelical movement's rejection of evolution and an ancient earth. Long before Darwin, it was well established in the sciences that the earth was, at the most conservative estimates, many hundreds of thousands of years old. To some, if the human history we know is only a tiny fraction of the history of life on earth, let alone the universe, it can't help but undermines Man's image of the earth as the stage for God's story through Man. But for many of the people pioneered the discovery of an ancient earth, deep time had a very different meaning, one which spoke to them of the glory and majesty of God.

One early proponent of an ancient earth was James Hutton, who published his masterwork *Theory of the Earth* in 1795, nearly a century before Darwin published *On the Origin of the Species*. Generally considered to be an impenetrable mess, his theories were popularized by his fiend John Playfair, who remarked: "On those of us who saw these phenomena for the first time, the impression made will not easily be forgotten… The mind seemed to grow giddy by looking so far into the abyss of time."

What made such an impression on Hutton and his friends was a geological feature he called an *unconformity*. As Stephen Jay Gould explains in his brilliant and accessible Time’s Arrow, Time’s Cycle, an unconformity is

> “...a fossil surface of erosion, a gap in time separating two episodes in the formation of rocks. Unconformities are direct evidence that the history of our earth includes several cycles of deposition and uplift."

> “I still use Hutton's drawing in my introductory courses to illustrate a principle that continues to stun me with its elegance after twenty annual repetitions—the complex panorama of history that can be inferred from the simple geometry of horizontal above vertical, once you understand the basic rules for deposition of strata. I can list a dozen distinct events that must have occurred to produce this geometry, with Hutton's unconformity as the key."

> "Since large expanses of water-laid strata must be deposited flat (or nearly so), the underlying vertical sequence arose at right angles to its current orientation. These strata were then broken, uplifted, and tilted to vertical in forming land above the ocean's surface. The land eroded, producing the uneven horizontal surface of the unconformity itself. Eventually, the seas rose again (or the land foundered) and waves further planed the old surface, producing a "pudding stone" of pebbles made from the vertical strata. Under the sea again, horizontal strata formed as products of the second cycle. Another period of uplift then raised these rocks above the sea once more, this time not breaking or tilting the strata. (Hutton reminds us that we must infer a second episode of uplift by drawing a meeting of phaeton and solitary horseman above the horizontal set of originally marine strata.) Thus, we see in this simple geometry of horizontal above vertical two great cycles of sedimentation with two episodes of uplift, the first tumultuous, the second more gentle."

Contemplating the enormous expanse of time evidenced by an unconformity fills me with a sense of sublime awe. Hiking in Great Falls, Virginia, walking over layers of rock laid by centuries of slow deposit at the bottom of an ocean, then turned ninety degrees by an unimaginably forceful event, I feel I am in touch with a vastness which is also totally beyond me. Yet it might be easy to mistake this giddiness for a thouroughly modern glee in iconoclasm. Conservative Christians often impcitly depict the struggle between, on the one hand, deep time and evolution, and on the other "creation science", as an ideological struggle between the iconoclasts and the traditionalists. For them, the people behind Man's great dethronements take a certain ilicit pleasure in humbling God and, through Him, Man, and this motiviates their endless quest to destroy every flattering image man ever had of himself. Unquestionably, many have such inclinations, myself included. But for Hutton, the motiviation was quite different. On the contrary, he saw the vastness of time as evidence that the earth had been made by God in specific accord with human nature: “a world contrived in consummate wisdom for the growth and habitation of a great diversity of plants and animals; and a world peculiarly adapted to the purpose of man, who inhabits all its climates, who measures its extent, and determines its productions at his pleasure.”

The history of naturalism from the 17th century up to Darwin is littered with examples of God-fearing men who, despite their explicit commitment to belief in God and unconscious acceptance a anthropocentric world picture, neverless laid the stones that would one day overturn that picture. It was not, first, a conscious desire to challenge God's authority, which then sought empirical justification; the bulk of the empirical evidence was accumulated by people who still carried with them the old picture of human design and destiny, and gradually came to light in spite of this preconception. Only when the evidence had accumulated for centuries did people begin to consciously challenge the unconscous assumptions. Only once evolution had already been cemented in the sciences did the ideological struggle, exemplified by the Scopes Monkey Trial, take precidence.

Over the course of the 20th century, American Evangelicalism took an increasingly hard-line, literalist approach to anything that smelled like evolution and atheism, including the idea of an ancient earth.

But it's difficult for moderns to fully escape the anxieties engendered by Man's dethronement via conscious denial. The fault runs so deep through the modern mind that it's almost impossible to fully, unconsciously believe in Man's centrality. But without an alternative mythology, most if not all of us rarely fully believe in Man's dethronement either. In his book *Full House*, *Stephen Jay Gould* demonstrates how the idea of Man as the end to which all of natural history leads slips into our common understanding of natural history:

> "My favorite example of unrecognized bias in depicting the history of life resides quite literally in the prictures we paint. We all know these series of paintings– from a first scene of trilobites in the Cambrian sea, through lots of dinosaurs in the middle, to a last picture of Cro-Magnon ancestors busy decorating a cave in France. We have viewed these sequences on the walls of natural history museums, and in coffee-table books about the history of life. Now what cound be wrong about such a series? Trilobites did dominate the first faunas of multicellular organisms; humans did arise only yesterday; and dinosaurs did flourish in between. So why am I complaining?"

> "The paintings are 'right' in a narrow sense. But nothing can be more misleading than formally correct but limited information drastically yanked out of context. (Remember the old story about the captain who disliked his first mate and recorded in the ship's log, after a unique episode, "First mate was drunk today." The mate begged the captain to remove the passage, stating correctly that this had never happened before and that his employment would be jeopardized. The captain refused. The mate kept the next day's log, and he recorded, "Captain was sober today.")

> "As for this nautical tale, so for the history of life. All the prominent paintings in this genre of prehistoric art claim to be portraying the nub or essence of life's history through time. They all begin with a scene or two of Paleozoic invertibrates. We note our first bias even here, for the prevertibrate seas span nearly half the history of multicellular animal life, yet never commandeer more than 10 percent of the pictures. As soon as fishes begin to prosper in the Devonian perido, underwater scenes switch to these first vertebrates–and we never see another invertebrate again for all the rest of the pageant. Even the fishes get short shrift, for not a single one ever appears again (except as fleeing prey for a an ichthyosaur or a mosauar) after the emergence of the terrestiral vertebrate life toward the end of the Paleozoic era...Invertibates didn't die or stop evolving after fishes appeared; much of their most important history unrolls in contemporaneous partnership with marine vertebrates...Similarly, fishes didn't die out or stop evolving just because one lineage of peripheral brethren managed to colonize the land."

> "Let me not carp unfairly. If these pageantries only claimed to be illustrating the ancestry of our tiny human twig on life's tree, then I would not complain, for I cannot quarrel unduly with such a parochial decision, stated up front. But these iconographic sequences always purport to be illustrating *the* history of life, not a tale of a twig...Much as we may love ourselves, *Homo sapiens* is not representative, or symbolic, of life as a whole. We are not surrogates for arthropods (more than 80% of animal species), or exemplars of anything either particular or typical. We are the possessors of one extraordinary evolutionary investment called consciousness–the factor that permits us, rather than any other species, to ruminate about such matters (or, rather, cows ruminate and we cogitate). But how can this invention be viewed as the distillation of life's primary thrust or direction when 80 percent of multicellularity enjoys such evolutionary success and displays no trend to neuroloical complexity through time–and when our own neural elaboration may just as well end up destroying us as sparking a move to any other state that we would choose to designate as 'higher'?"

In light of our new (compared to the long history of Homo sapiens) self-understanding, Gould suggests we "trade the traditional source of human solace in separation for a more interesting view of life in union with other createures as one contingent element of a much larger history. We must give up a cconventional notion of human domination, but we learn to cherish particulars, of which we are but one, and to revel in the complete ranges, to which we contriute one precious point–a good swap, I would argue, of stale (and false) comfort for broader understanding. It is, indeed, a wonderful life within the full house of our planet's history of organic diversity."

Contrast the atheism of Gould with that of Stephen Pinker or Richard Dawkins, who explicitly deny the existence of God, but still implicitly speak as if the Great Commission were in effect. Theirs is another answer to the problem of how to deal with the death of God:

## The Humanist Solution: Ignore It

> Between believers and non-believers, there is only a razor's edge; on both sides of the razor, the abyss of willful ignorance.

From the ashes of God's demise, a simple solution rises: put Man in his place. Instead of the Natural and the Good being given to Man by God, the Natural and the Good will be given by Man to himself, in accordance with his own nature. This is the thrust of many currents of enlightenment rationalism, including my own dear Spinoza. This much Christian conservatives percieve and decry. What they react to is the audacity of Man determining his own ends. How, given Man's falibility, his depravity, how dimly he sees, can he determine his own ends? And indeed, the history of modernity is the history of Man trying and failing to legislate itself. But what conservatives fail to see is that the Secular Humanists are but the other side of the coin of Christianity. As Nietzsche demonstrates, the death of God is Man's retroactive realization that he was always, in reality, legislating himself, whether he does so consciously and in his own name, or whether he attributes Nature to a separate being in Man's image called God. Through God, man makes the world in the image of himself. Whether believer or atheist, the thing that matters is whether one still sees the world in God/Man's image. Both flatter Man's vanity, irrespective of one's inclination toward perfectibility or fallibility.<sup><a id="foot7" href="#cite7">7</a></sup>

I don't personally know how Dawkins and Pinker maintain their optimism at the prospect of self-creating man, but I do not share it. However, true things are true whether or not they make your life more difficult. No doubt it is, in some senses, easier to believe that meaning and purpose are self-evident and eternal. No doubt it is easier to have certainty of what is and isn't natural, from a source that cannot be questioned. But I have no choice to embark on the terrible adventure of becoming worthy of the murder of God, a murder I fell into much as Adam and Eve fell into sin, a deed done before it was possible for them to comprehend its meaning. As I've come to understand it, the history of human life is comprised of a series of falls into seemingly insoluble problems. Maybe only a God can save us. But nothing could convince me to settle for a simulacra god, half-believed out of fear of what might happen if we consciously take the reigns that have been in our hands all along.

## The Post Humanist Solution: Change our subconscious idea of ourselves

While it should be obvious by now this is the solution I prefer, I confess it is nearly impossible. Subconscious models of the world don't need to be true to motivate behavior, and they don't necessarily respond to reasoning. At times, it feels like the modern world is implicitly atheist; whether one believes in God or not, most moderns, including conservatives, don't take seriously the idea that Humans are the center of the world. But at other times, it feels like the old model of Man as the apex of the natural world is alive, well, and consciously believed by most people. Modernity is in large part defined by this double vision, this inability to lock in a clear idea of our relationship to the world and its meaning.

This problem, the problem of modernity, is rather an old one. Nietzsche and his contemporaries attempted to go beyond it well before evolution became the generally accepted theory of the origin of life. What defines *post*modernity, for thinkers like Jean Francious Lyotard, is not just our inability to believe in the centrality of man, but in any coherent, unifying theory of reality at all:

> "Science has always been in conflict with narratives. Judged by the yardstick of science, the majority of them prove to be fables. But to the extent that science does not restrict itself to stating useful regularities and seeks the truth, it is obliged to legitimate the rules of its own game. It then produces a discourse of legitimation with respect to its own status, a discourse called philosophy. I will use the term *modern* to designate any science that legitimates itself with reference to a metadiscourse of this kind making an explicit appeal to some grand narrative, such as the dialectics of Spirit, the hermeneutics of meaning, the emancipation of the rational or working subject, or the creation of wealth. For example, the rule of consensus between the sender and addressee of a statement with truth-value is deemed acceptable if it is cast in terms of a possible unanimity between rational minds: this is the Enlightenment narrative, in which the hero of knowledge works toward a good ethico-political end–universal peace. As can be seen from this example, if a metanarrative implying a philosophy of history is used to legitimate knowledge, questions are raised concerning the validity of the institutions governing the social bond: these must be legitimated as well. Thus justice is consigned to the grand narrative in the same way as truth."

> "Simplifying to the extreme, I define postmodem as incredulity toward metanarratives. This incredulity is undoubtedly a product of progress in the sciences: but that progress in turn presupposes it. To the obsolescence of the metanarrative apparatus of legitimation corresponds; most notably, the crisis of metaphysical philosophy and of the university institution which in the past relied on it. The narrative function is losing it functors, its great hero, its great dangers, its great voyages, its great goal. It is being dispersed in clouds of narrative language elements–narrative, but also denotative, prescriptive, descriptive, and so on. Conveyed within each cloud are pragmatic valencies specific to its kind. Each of us lives at the intersection of many of these. However, we do not necessarily establish stable language combinations, and the properties of the ones we do establish are not necessarily communicable."

> "Thus the society of the future falls less within the province of a Newtonian anthropology (such as stucturalism or systems theory) than a pragmatics of language particles. There are many different language games-a heterogeneity of elements. They only give rise to institutions in patches-local determinism."

> "The decision makers, however, attempt to manage these clouds of sociality according to input/output matrices, following a logic which implies that their elements are commensurable and that the whole is determinable. They allocate our lives for the growth of power. In matters of social justice and of scientific truth alike, the legitimation I of that power is based on its optimizing the system's performance–efficiency. The application of this criterion to all of our games necessarily entails a certain level of terror, whether soft or hard: be operational (that is, commensurable) or disappear. The logic of maximum performance is no doubt inconsistent in many ways, particularly with respect to contradiction in the socio-economic field: it demands both less work (to lower production costs) and more (to lessen the social burden of the idle population). But our incredulity is now such that we no longer expect salvation to rise from these inconsistencies, as did Marx."

Since the collapse of the Soviet Union and the defeat of communism, we passed from a time when alternative metanarratives competed to define the meaning of history, to an era in which no one *really* believes history has a meaning. Those who do seem almost comically credulous and out of touch (irony and cringe culture.) We spend more time arguing and telling stories than ever, but none of them seem to take hold of us, and we need more of them than ever. It is in this sense that I talk about "postmodern" conservatism; it fixates on Culture Wars, lacks any positive or coherent political program, and the only sense in which it attempts to tell a totalizing story is negatively through the creation of relentless, external enemies. But it is not just conservatism; our politics seem dominated by this frenzied statis, all the more metastable the more it keeps us in a state of constant excitation and exhaustion.

How to overcome to this impasse? Can we can *will* ourselves back into believing in a lost totality? Perhaps the constant demand to restore a common language, a common *sense* is *itself* part of how the system reinforces itself. Lyotard, far from being against postmodernity, points out the "severe reexamination which postmodernity imposes on the thought of the Enlightenment, on the idea of a unitary end of history and of a subject", an "illusion" which can only be maintained through "terror". "The nineteenth and twentieth centuries have given us as much terror as we can take. We have paid a high enough price for the nostalgia of the whole and the one, for the reconciliation of the concept and the sensible, of the transparent and the communicable experience. Under the general demand for slackening and for appeasement, we can hear the mutterings of the desire for a return of terror, for the realization of the fantasy to seize reality. The answer is: Let us wage a war on totality; let us be witness to the unpresentable; let us activate the differences and save the honor of the name."

To not give into the temptation to let a fantasy seize realtity is, as near as I can formulate it, the essence of anti-nihilism. All this thinking and speaking and acting and analysing and buying and selling and yet the engine of capital churns on, grinding every human practice and belief into a salable commodity, tuning our every thought and reaction up to a codeable, manageable fever pitch. "A long twilight that bleeds out to the edges of time where even the most fantastic things become banal." Who knows where it will end? If nothing else, be kind.

<a id="cite2" href="#foot2">2.</a> Fundamentalist minister Vernon C. Lyons writes in his ludicrous essay [Why Baptists Are Not Protestants](https://acbc.ie/resources/PDF%27s-&-Files/Why-Baptists-are-not-Protestants.pdf): "Baptists make no effort to trace a historical succession back to the age of the Apostles. Their only claim is that at every age in church history there have been groups that have held to the same doctrines that Baptists hold today... [by contrast,] the Protestant groups look to some human being as their founder, often even taking their name from a man. The Lutherans arise with Luther. The Reformed look to John Calvin. The Presbyterians were founded by John Knox. The Methodists openly acknowledge John Wesley as their founder. Who founded the Baptist churches? Here is a historical question worthy of serious investigation [by who? Surely not Baptists??]. It is impossible [!!] to find any one man who gave rise to Baptist churches. Rather, if we would name human founders, we must look back to Peter, Paul, James and John." This ahistorical assertion is a time honored tradition among sectarian Protestants; what has any Protestant denomination ever said about itself, but that it is, at long last, a return to the scriptures?

<a id="cite4" href="#foot4">4.</a> Throughout this section, I use he/him pronouns to refer to the *Deus siva Natura* described by Spinoza, in conformity with his own style. I made this choice because I feel, as no doubt Spinoza did also, that they would make his concepts more digestible to people used to speaking of God in anthropomorphic terms. I want to be clear however, that I don't think it makes any sense to attribute such human traits as gender to the supreme cause.

<a id="cite5" href="#foot5">5.</a> It is common knowledge at this point that conservative and liberal as dispositions have a biological basis; how sensitive a person is to the physical sensation of disgust is highly predictive of their political beliefs. Beyond the basic acceptance that this link exists however, one must be exceedingly careful not reductively assume that conservatism as a political movement is comprised of the anal-retentive individuals, while liberalism captures the diarrhetic; many if not most liberals I've encountered have shockingly weak stomachs for novelty. Not that this implies the reverse is more than rarely true, as self-identified conservatives cannot without hypocrisy avow a taste for the new.

<a id="cite6" href="#foot6">6.</a> For the record, I think that the monopoly of capital over the means of communication is absolutely a crisis which demands immediate action. But if we're being consistent, part of free speech in market liberalism is that, if you own a platform, you have the right to exclude speech you don't like, for any reason. Conservatives were fine with this dynamic when conservative ideas garnered more respect in the mainstream; now that capital has in many cases gone Woke, they find this feature of market liberalism unacceptable.

<a id="cite7" href="#foot7">7.</a>  This is what Freud calls the "narcissism of minor differences". People who's ideas and assumptions are ultimately very similar to us, except for their answer to one or two questions, appear to be more different than us than people who's concepts are so foreign, they fail to agitate us. This is easy to spot in others once you have the concept, but hard to apply to yourself.
rowing up in evangelical churches, I was warned time and again that the belief in and worship of God was the cornerstone holding the universe together. Without the certain knowledge of God in my heart, all the world would seem a cacophonous confusion of suffering and death, an endless series of mechanical spasms shoving each other through infinite space and time; in short, nihilism. And indeed, from when I began to lose my faith as a pre teen, up into my 20s, that's exactly how the world felt to me. An intolerable, unredeemed place which lacked even the capacity for redemption. But sadly, the fact that the prophecy came true was of no help to me. Because conviction, whether we possess it or lack it, by definition is that part of us which cannot submit to what is psychologically or socially beneficial. I would have given anything to believe in an all loving and all powerful God, to put an end to the torment I inflicted on myself and the bitterness I harbored against the world. But my unfaith would not yield to what I so desperately wanted to be true. No wishing or pleading could wipe away the simple truth carved into on my heart: "Rain falls on the good and the bad alike; an unjust world cannot be the product of an all-loving and all-powerful God; he is either indifferent to human affairs, or he does not exist."

While my core belief about the world, namely that there is no final guarantor of justice, has not changed, I've always found the equation of this belief with nihilism to be irritating. Conservative public figures like Jordan Peterson often diagnose modern society as nihilistic, drawing heavily on thinkers like Friedrich Nietzsche and Fyodor Dostoevsky. But my primary motivating ethic, the very thing that makes belief in God impossible for Nietzsche, myself, and I suspect also for Peterson, is precisely a rejection of nihilism. If the evidence suggests that we cannot justifiably believe in God, a fixed human nature, or other beliefs which have unquestionably been of use to human societies, we cannot *make* ourselves believe them simply because it is beneficial to do so. In the words of Martin Heidegger, an atheist with all the fear and trembling of the devout:

> Only a god can still save us. I think the only possibility of salvation left to us is to prepare readiness, through thinking and poetry, for the appearance of the god or for the absence of the god during the decline; so that we do not, simply put, die meaningless deaths, but that when we decline, we decline in the face of the absent god.<sup><a id="foot1" href="#cite1">1</a></sup>

In other words, even if you believe a world without God is intolerable, unstable, and unsustainable, better to decline in truth than to prosper in a lie. The conditions of modernity have conspired to make it so no one who is dependent on the modern societies for their survival can totally escape the dangerous spirit of questioning. In order to resolve this anxiety, conservatives finds scapegoats; it is not you who feels uncertain in the face of an overwhelming torrent of possible beliefs about the world, it is Critical Race Theorists, Post-Modern Neo-Marxists, and Gender Ideologues who are producing dangerous, motivated ideas to attack and pervert your correct, self-evident, eternal way of seeing the world. It is not that your beliefs are difficult to maintain in a world of instantaneous communication and unprecedented growth of the natural sciences; the problem is that they are under attack by people who are not fighting fair, people who fear and resent your beliefs.

But there is something contradictory about this narrative. If the scapegoating accounts of nihilism in conservative media were right, conservatives would have nothing to fear from progressives; after all, they have meaning and purpose, founded in self evident and unshakable faith; what could godless, decadent liberal elites offer to compete with such assurance? Why do children need to be protected, through censorship and withdrawal from public life, from ideas which are transparently empty and unsatisfying? And yet churches, along with every other institution of collective life, continue to hemorrhage membership. Those that remain resort to increasingly illiberal means to maintain themselves and their children in their beliefs, and become increasingly violent towards anyone who threatens those beliefs. Just as something feels unmistakably weak and unmanly about someone who constantly talks about masculinity, the conservative fixation on nihilism carries a whiff of confession. The truth is that there *is* an ongoing crisis of meaning in modernity, which *no one has thus far been able to once and for all surmount*; though many have lived beautiful lives, made magnificent works, and deepened the hues of the problem, precisely by refusing to displace it onto easy scapegoats. In the face of such difficulty, the only truly nihilistic thing to do is to shut one's eyes, stop one's ears, and pretend to a certainty which one cannot justifiably posses.

With that in mind, I'd like to trace the contours of the crisis of meaning, through the lens of of how American Evangelicals, Conservatives, and the various currents that mix therein, talk about it. I'll start with a brief discussion of the origin of the western conception of meaning and purpose; next, I hope to clarify what I believe conservatives mean when they attribute to modernity a crisis of meaning; I'll then sketch a rough picture of how I think nihilism ought rightly to be understood; and lastly, I'll explore how Evangelicals' intentional distortion of natural history, a natural history pioneered almost exclusively by devout Christian ministers, is itself the height of nihilism.

# Meaning and Purpose

![Life is meaningless / life is unbearably meaningful / ayyy lmao](/meaningful.jpg)

"What is the meaning of life?" seems at first glance like a simple, obvious question, which any philosopher worth the name ought to be able to answer. But the question itself neatly hides all sorts of metaphysical assumptions which have to be first unpacked before the question can even be posed. For example, "meaning" is a feature of language; words generally to refer to an something happening in this thing we call reality. For example, the word "tree" refers to the set of objects which have roots, hard bark-covered trunks, branches, and leaves. Even when words refer to something abstract, like countries or political ideologies, they are assumed to relate to something outside of language, which is more real than the word used to designate it. But to ask what the meaning of life is is to reverse this assumption; it is to assume that life, the ground of our intelligible reality, *refers* to something *within language*. This assumption might be true; it may be, as Jordan Peterson explicitly believes, and many Christians implicitly believe, that what happens in physical reality is an effect of something nonphysical happening elsewhere, in a immaterial, meaning-ful realm. But the assumption in the question decides everything important about the answer; by the time one asks what the meaning of life is, one has already implicitly decided that what happens in reality is a mere reflection of something outside of it.

For now, we can neatly side step the issue of whether existence precedes essence by asking a different question, which I think is what most people mean when they ask after life's meaning: "what is the *purpose* of life?" This we can answer without immediately confronting the problem of transcendence.

The idea of objects having a purpose is a natural and intuitive one. Even without having seen a hammer in use, if one is acquainted with both the human body and tool use in general, it is very possible one might correctly guess the purpose of a hammer is to drive nails and perform other tasks requiring force applied in a small area. From this inference, it seems natural to assume that all hammers were created for this purpose, and you'd be right in that assumption. Aristotle went so far as to claim that purpose, or "final cause", is one of the four causes which every object has which together bring it into being. Whether that be a human creating the object for their use, or one of the gods creating it to serve some greater or lesser function in the harmonious maintenance of the world, all objects have some purpose with respect to the uses rational beings may put to them.

It's impossible to overstate how important the idea of final cause has been to Western, Christian thought. Evangelicals often claim that their beliefs are derived solely by the divinely inspired Bible, completely ignorant of the many currents running alongside that influence their basic concepts and perceptions. Let's leave aside the mental contortions required to believe not a single letter of a text cobbled together from dozens of sources over 8,000 years has not a single important error; the proliferation of denominations even within Protestantism, many with incompatible interpretations, must lead one to conclude that at minimum, the interpretations themselves constitute social knowledge which is outside the text, and proclaimed ignorance of the influence of ideas which do not originate in the sole authorized text does not make them disappear<sup><a id="foot2" href="#cite2">2</a></sup>. The Evangelical of today would be well served by knowing they owe far more to St. Augustine, a medieval scholar who synthesized Christianity with the then-newly-rediscovered Greek philosophical tradition, than they do to, say, Elijah.

Why does final cause matter so much? Why is the concept inextricably bound up with the unbearable sense of lost purpose I felt when I lost my faith in God? To answer this question, I will turn to Spinoza:

> "...All such opinions spring from the notion commonly entertained, that all things in nature act as men themselves act, namely, with an end in view. It is accepted as certain, that God himself directs all things to a definite goal (for it is said that God made all things for man, and man that he might worship him). I will, therefore, consider this opinion, asking first, why it obtains general credence, and why all men are naturally so prone to adopt it? Secondly, I will point out its falsity; and, lastly, I will show how it has given rise to prejudices about good and bad, right and wrong, praise and blame, order and confusion, beauty and ugliness, and the like. However, this is not the place to deduce these misconceptions from the nature of the human mind: it will be sufficient here, if I assume as a starting point, what ought to be universally admitted, namely, that all men are born ignorant of the causes of things, that all have the desire to seek for what is useful to them, and that they are conscious of such desire. Herefrom it follows, first, that men think themselves free inasmuch as they are conscious of their volitions and desires, and never even dream, in their ignorance, of the causes which have disposed them so to wish and desire. Secondly, that men do all things for an end, namely, for that which is useful to them, and which they seek. Thus it comes to pass that they only look for a knowledge of the final causes of events, and when these are learned, they are content, as having no cause for further doubt. If they cannot learn such causes from external sources, they are compelled to turn to considering themselves, and reflecting what end would have induced them personally to bring about the given event, and thus they necessarily judge other natures by their own. Further, as they find in themselves and outside themselves many means which assist them not a little in the search for what is useful, for instance, eyes for seeing, teeth for chewing, herbs and animals for yielding food, the sun for giving light, the sea for breeding fish, &c., they come to look on the whole of nature as a means for obtaining such conveniences. Now as they are aware, that they found these conveniences and did not make them, they think they have cause for believing, that some other being has made them for their use. As they look upon things as means, they cannot believe them to be self—created; but, judging from the means which they are accustomed to prepare for themselves, they are bound to believe in some ruler or rulers of the universe endowed with human freedom, who have arranged and adapted everything for human use. They are bound to estimate the nature of such rulers (having no information on the subject) in accordance with their own nature, and therefore they assert that the gods ordained everything for the use of man, in order to bind man to themselves and obtain from him the highest honor. Hence also it follows, that everyone thought out for himself, according to his abilities, a different way of worshipping God, so that God might love him more than his fellows, and direct the whole course of nature for the satisfaction of his blind cupidity and insatiable avarice. Thus the prejudice developed into superstition, and took deep root in the human mind; and for this reason everyone strove most zealously to understand and explain the final causes of things; but in their endeavor to show that nature does nothing in vain, i.e. nothing which is useless to man, they only seem to have demonstrated that nature, the gods, and men are all mad together. Consider, I pray you, the result: among the many helps of nature they were bound to find some hindrances, such as storms, earthquakes, diseases, &c.: so they declared that such things happen, because the gods are angry at some wrong done to them by men, or at some fault committed in their worship. Experience day by day protested and showed by infinite examples, that good and evil fortunes fall to the lot of pious and impious alike; still they would not abandon their inveterate prejudice, for it was more easy for them to class such contradictions among other unknown things of whose use they were ignorant, and thus to retain their actual and innate condition of ignorance, than to destroy the whole fabric of their reasoning and start afresh. They therefore laid down as an axiom, that God's judgments far transcend human understanding. Such a doctrine might well have sufficed to conceal the truth from the human race for all eternity, if mathematics had not furnished another standard of verity in considering solely the essence and properties of figures without regard to their final causes."<sup><a id="foot3" href="#cite3">3</a></sup>

Spinoza posits a rather straightforward psychological explanation of how humans come to view the purposes to which rational beings put objects as an essential characteristic of all objects. Aristotle elevated spontaneous misconception to a metaphysical law, a law which Christianity, and most secular Westerners, inherit without knowing it; so that it makes sense when seeking the truth of any object, let alone life itself, to ask "what is its purpose?" He goes on to suggest God may not impose such a rule on himself as we, being creatures of purposeful action, project on him<sup><a id="foot4" href="#cite4">4</a></sup>:

> "There is no need to show at length, that nature has no particular goal in view, and that final causes are mere human figments...everything in nature proceeds from a sort of necessity, and with the utmost perfection. However, I will add a few remarks, in order to overthrow this doctrine of a final cause utterly. That which is really a cause it considers as an effect, and vice versâ: it makes that which is by nature first to be last, and that which is highest and most perfect to be most imperfect. Passing over the questions of cause and priority as self—evident, it is plain that the effect is most perfect which is produced immediately by God; the effect which requires for its production several intermediate causes is, in that respect, more imperfect. But if those things which were made immediately by God were made to enable him to attain his end, then the things which come after, for the sake of which the first were made, are necessarily the most excellent of all... this doctrine does away with the perfection of God: for, if God acts for an object, he necessarily desires something which he lacks. Certainly, theologians and metaphysicians draw a distinction between the object of want and the object of assimilation; still they confess that God made all things for the sake of himself, not for the sake of creation. They are unable to point to anything prior to creation, except God himself, as an object for which God should act, and are therefore driven to admit (as they clearly must), that God lacked those things for whose attainment he created means, and further that he desired them."

> "If all things follow from a necessity of the absolutely perfect nature of God, why are there so many imperfections in nature? Such, for instance, as things corrupt to the point of putridity, loathsome deformity, confusion, evil, sin, &c. But these reasoners are, as I have said, easily confuted, for the perfection of things is to be reckoned only from their own nature and power; things are not more or less perfect, according as they delight or offend human senses, or according as they are serviceable or repugnant to mankind. To those who ask why God did not so create all men, that they should be governed only by reason, I give no answer but this: because matter was not lacking to him for the creation of every degree of perfection from highest to lowest; or, more strictly, because the laws of his nature are so vast, as to suffice for the production of everything conceivable by an infinite intelligence."

Spinoza's metaphysics are beautiful, positive, and frightening; his *Deus siva Natura* (God *or* Nature, whichever helps one dispose of anthropomorphic projections on the supreme cause) is joyfully, infinitely powerful, and neither knows nor needs an external purpose or meaning to be what he is; he simply is, and his perfection rests in that infinite "is" for itself, of which we each are a part in our determinate, finite existence. While Spinoza's God is indifferent to human aims, it is not cruelly but joyfully so; and I find this hard but joyful world more blessed than a loving God without power, more agreeable than a powerful God without love, and infinitely more true to the evidence of my senses than a God who is both.

But Spinoza is not blind to the difficulty of accepting his way of seeing things. At the end of his ethics, he writes:

> "If the way which I have pointed out as leading to this result seems exceedingly hard, it may nevertheless be discovered. Needs must it be hard, since it is so seldom found. How would it be possible, if salvation were ready to our hand, and could without great labour be found, that it should be by almost all men neglected? But all things excellent are as difficult as they are rare."

All this is not to say that the question of the meaning or purpose of life is not a symptom of a genuine crisis in the modern world. As Spinoza points out, humans cannot help but be purposeful beings, though we suffer inordinately when we mistakenly believe nature herself to be so oriented. But it is unquestionably true that modernity, since the time of Dostoevsky, Nietzsche, and Marx, has struggled unsuccessfully to answer without possible reversal the question "what purpose should we put ourselves to, as individuals and as societies?" So I wanted to begin by circumscribing the crisis properly. When conservatives describe a loss of meaning, I believe that in nearly all cases they mean one of the following:

- A feeling that the purpose of human life has lost its immutable, eternal character. Purpose is now felt to be a part of contested history, and this is intolerable.
- A feeling that the stories which once bound people together (religion, progress, etc.) have lost their power to compel belief.
- An objection to decadent (meaning unsustainable, but also generally hedonist) cultural practices.

All three of these problems are projected onto external enemies of real, ordinary Americans, people who generally know without asking what they want and why. Their enemies are always painted with the same broad brushstrokes, though always with new names:

- Insufferably opaque academics who talk nonsense to feel themselves superior to ordinary people, and who desperately need to indoctrinate the young to prop up their fragile beliefs 
- Ugly, perverse men, deluded into believing they are women, who need to involve children in their perversity to validate their identities
- Muslims who are replacing the white population through affirmative action and free abortions
- The Hollywood media moguls and billionaires, who move the others like pawns on a chessboard, ever closer to their goal of destroying America once and for all

These caricatures are usually denied by conservatives when confronted in all their lurid detail; but one can find countless examples on the seedy underbelly of the internet, where people feel free to play with the full pallet of their anxieties. But as conservatives feel more isolated and threatened, and as the walls between public and private communication crumble, the effort to maintain a public, respectable conservatism falls increasingly behind the ever mounting pressure of its raw, lewd expression.

While I absolutely reject the all-to-easy scapegoating of the weird and marginalized, the crises they are responsive to are absolutely real, and urgently demand wisdom and action from the entire human race. Endlessly, performatively condemning the scapegoating, implicitly denying that anything is wrong other than moral failures on the part of conservatives, does nothing but obscure and reinforce the underlying problems. I'm not here to virtue signal, but to acknowledge with humility how old and how serious the problem is. Because the truly unbearable truth is that the crisis of modernity is by no means a lack of meaning, but a sublime, unholy torrent, always threatening to overwhelm any single human intellect.

# The Right to Ignorance

Anyone who uses the internet to any degree will inevitably find themselves exposed to ideas and practices utterly foreign to themselves, many of which provoke a gut reaction of disgust. Due to a confluence of factors, from the need for capitalist economies to forcibly open trade between cultures, to acceleration in the speed of travel and communication, to the unprecedented collapse of language diversity, people are more connected than ever before. Yet this doesn't necessarily mean we *feel* connected, or that we use that connection to foster understanding and cooperation. At times we experience this perpetual connection as a blessing and delight, and at others as an intolerable burden and nuisance; but for those of a conservative disposition<sup><a id="foot5" href="#cite5">5</a></sup>, it may be experienced more often as provocation than opportunity. This dynamic undoubtedly favors those with either an innate or cultivated appreciation for openness and exchange, but not, as conservatives often imply, because of a conspiracy on the part of a sinister cabal bent on the destruction of everything simple and innocent, but due the basic dynamics of instant communication. At a certain point, having in-depth knowledge of every possible human practice is incompatible with the belief that one's own way form of existence is the only acceptable form. One must either forcibly close the floodgates, or, without realizing it, slide into some sort of cosmopolitanism.

The sort of conservatives who can't help but constantly remind us that they are and want to be a part of the public discourse are then a seeming contradiction. Which is why I see an important distinction between systematic rejections of modernity, like the Amish, and postmodern conservatism, a movement which is thoroughly embedded in and defined by the problems of a modernity it claims to reject. Conservatives claim to be committed to classical enlightenment values like free speech, democracy, the marketplace of ideas, and Reals over Feels. But these values inevitably come into conflict with other conservative values and ideals. In the last several generations, conservative Christianity has been losing share in that marketplace, especially among the young. For conservatives, it cannot be that the message they are putting forward is, on its own merits, unappealing to the majority of people, including their own children. Someone must not be playing fair. To justify this belief, while maintaining some semblance of commitment to free inquiry, they employ totalizing narratives that allow them to scapegoat the situation onto others who have an unfair advantage. Some examples:

- The democratic process is illegitimate and untrustworthy. Democrats are cheating with fake votes, and bribing people who are not Real Americans as we define it; under these circumstances, it is impossible for us to win. Therefore, although we are the real defenders of democracy, we cannot use democracy to win. Since they are not fighting fair, we don't have to either.
- Parents have the absolute right to decide what their children learn and who they associate with. Anyone who attempts to teach children a way of understanding the world their parents do not approve of is abusive. Parents have the absolute right to define what is and isn't abusive as far as their children are concerned.
- In a world with genuine free speech, conservative ideas would be respectable in the public discourse. If conservative ideas are excluded from or not respected in mainstream communication platforms, this cannot be the result of individuals exercising their first amendment right to exclude speech they dislike; it must constitute illegitimate censorship.<sup><a id="foot6" href="#cite6">6</a></sup>
- Most higher education institutions lean liberal. This must be an artificial result of certain individuals in pursuit of power and money. We are committed to capital T Truth, but people who are educated are for the most part corrupted by an outside, motivated influence, therefore education itself is to be viewed with suspicion, unless it is grounded in a commitment to conservative principles.

All these narratives cover over what seems, if you take a longer view than conservatives usually do, to be an inevitable tendency of modernity, and of the classical liberal values that postmodern conservatives claim to be committed to. Modernity is liberalizing. If one enjoys the benefits of free thought and market competition, one also inevitably opens the doors to all sorts of degenerate cosmopolitanism. To seal the breach, one must invent a menagerie of villians out to destroy the Christian way of life for a combination of profit and pure pleasure in destruction. But I would contend that conservatives who participate in modern societies, regardless of their explicit beliefs about God and Nature, are atheists in all the ways that matter.

# What is an atheist?

Freud diagnosed the crisis of modernity as the result of three great blows on Man's naive image of himself:

> "Humanity has in the course of time had to endure from the hands of science two great outrages upon its naive self-love. The first was when it realized that our earth was not the center of the universe, but only a tiny speck in a world-system of a magnitude hardly conceivable; this is associated in our minds with the name of Copernicus, although Alexandrian doctrines taught something very similar. The second was when biological research robbed man of his peculiar privilege of having been specially created, and relegated him to a descent from the animal world, implying an ineradicable animal nature in him: this transvaluation has been accomplished in our own time upon the instigation of Charles Darwin, Wallace, and their predecessors, and not without the most violent opposition from their contemporaries. But man's craving for grandiosity is now suffering the third and most bitter blow from present-day psychological research which is endeavoring to prove to the ego of each one of us that he is not even master in his own house, but that he must remain content with the veriest scraps of information about what is going on unconsciously in his own mind."

Humans, even non-western ones, have long enjoyed the privilege of telling stories about themselves that place them at the center of the cosmos. While this way of looking at things can and does arise spontaneously in many cultures, it is particularly dogmatic in western thought. The world is the creation of a God with human-like qualities, who made the world in order to place his most special and God-like creation, Man, in charge of it. Originally, everything, from the highest to the lowest, exists for his use and enjoyment. It was an aberration, a fault, that made it so some things in nature come into conflict with Man's. While Galileo did not originate the theory of heliocentrism, his conflict with the church demonstrates how long-established scientific theories can come into sudden and violent conflict with the way a human culture subconsciously sees itself, and how hard it is to change those subconscious ideas once established, evidence be damned.

I believe one can see modernity as a series of endless repetitions of one of three solutions to the crisis of Man's humiliation by his own inquiry:

## The Evangelical Solution: Denial

![John Clerk of Eldin – Unconformity at Jedburgh, Borders (engraving)](/unconformity.jpg)

Another example of a violent clash between the discoveries of the empirical sciences and society's unconscious beliefs is the American Evangelical movement's rejection of evolution and an ancient earth. Long before Darwin, it was well established in the sciences that the earth was, at the most conservative estimates, many hundreds of thousands of years old. To some, if the human history we know is only a tiny fraction of the history of life on earth, let alone the universe, it can't help but undermines Man's image of the earth as the stage for God's story through Man. But for many of the people pioneered the discovery of an ancient earth, deep time had a very different meaning, one which spoke to them of the glory and majesty of God.

One early proponent of an ancient earth was James Hutton, who published his masterwork *Theory of the Earth* in 1795, nearly a century before Darwin published *On the Origin of the Species*. Generally considered to be an impenetrable mess, his theories were popularized by his fiend John Playfair, who remarked: "On those of us who saw these phenomena for the first time, the impression made will not easily be forgotten… The mind seemed to grow giddy by looking so far into the abyss of time."

What made such an impression on Hutton and his friends was a geological feature he called an *unconformity*. As Stephen Jay Gould explains in his brilliant and accessible Time’s Arrow, Time’s Cycle, an unconformity is

> “...a fossil surface of erosion, a gap in time separating two episodes in the formation of rocks. Unconformities are direct evidence that the history of our earth includes several cycles of deposition and uplift."

> “I still use Hutton's drawing in my introductory courses to illustrate a principle that continues to stun me with its elegance after twenty annual repetitions—the complex panorama of history that can be inferred from the simple geometry of horizontal above vertical, once you understand the basic rules for deposition of strata. I can list a dozen distinct events that must have occurred to produce this geometry, with Hutton's unconformity as the key."

> "Since large expanses of water-laid strata must be deposited flat (or nearly so), the underlying vertical sequence arose at right angles to its current orientation. These strata were then broken, uplifted, and tilted to vertical in forming land above the ocean's surface. The land eroded, producing the uneven horizontal surface of the unconformity itself. Eventually, the seas rose again (or the land foundered) and waves further planed the old surface, producing a "pudding stone" of pebbles made from the vertical strata. Under the sea again, horizontal strata formed as products of the second cycle. Another period of uplift then raised these rocks above the sea once more, this time not breaking or tilting the strata. (Hutton reminds us that we must infer a second episode of uplift by drawing a meeting of phaeton and solitary horseman above the horizontal set of originally marine strata.) Thus, we see in this simple geometry of horizontal above vertical two great cycles of sedimentation with two episodes of uplift, the first tumultuous, the second more gentle."

Contemplating the enormous expanse of time evidenced by an unconformity fills me with a sense of sublime awe. Hiking in Great Falls, Virginia, walking over layers of rock laid by centuries of slow deposit at the bottom of an ocean, then turned ninety degrees by an unimaginably forceful event, I feel I am in touch with a vastness which is also totally beyond me. Yet it might be easy to mistake this giddiness for a thouroughly modern glee in iconoclasm. Conservative Christians often implicitly depict the struggle between, on the one hand, deep time and evolution, and on the other "creation science", as an ideological struggle between the iconoclasts and the traditionalists. For them, the people behind Man's great dethronements take a certain illicit pleasure in humbling God and, through Him, Man, and this motiviates their endless quest to destroy every flattering image man ever had of himself. Unquestionably, many have such inclinations, myself included. But for Hutton, the motivation was quite different. On the contrary, he saw the vastness of time as evidence that the earth had been made by God in specific accord with human nature: “a world contrived in consummate wisdom for the growth and habitation of a great diversity of plants and animals; and a world peculiarly adapted to the purpose of man, who inhabits all its climates, who measures its extent, and determines its productions at his pleasure.”

The history of naturalism from the 17th century up to Darwin is littered with examples of God-fearing men who, despite their explicit commitment to belief in God and unconscious acceptance a anthropocentric world picture, nevertheless laid the stones that would one day overturn that picture. It was not, first, a conscious desire to challenge God's authority, which then sought empirical justification; the bulk of the empirical evidence was accumulated by people who still carried with them the old picture of human design and destiny, and gradually came to light in spite of this preconception. Only when the evidence had accumulated for centuries did people begin to consciously challenge the unconscious assumptions. Only once evolution had already been cemented in the sciences did the ideological struggle, exemplified by the Scopes Monkey Trial, take precedence.

Over the course of the 20th century, American Evangelicalism took an increasingly hard-line, literalist approach to anything that smelled like evolution and atheism, including the idea of an ancient earth.

But it's difficult for moderns to fully escape the anxieties engendered by Man's dethronement via conscious denial. The fault runs so deep through the modern mind that it's almost impossible to fully, unconsciously believe in Man's centrality. But without an alternative mythology, most if not all of us rarely fully believe in Man's dethronement either. In his book *Full House*, *Stephen Jay Gould* demonstrates how the idea of Man as the end to which all of natural history leads slips into our common understanding of natural history:

> "My favorite example of unrecognized bias in depicting the history of life resides quite literally in the pictures we paint. We all know these series of paintings– from a first scene of trilobites in the Cambrian sea, through lots of dinosaurs in the middle, to a last picture of Cro-Magnon ancestors busy decorating a cave in France. We have viewed these sequences on the walls of natural history museums, and in coffee-table books about the history of life. Now what could be wrong about such a series? Trilobites did dominate the first faunas of multicellular organisms; humans did arise only yesterday; and dinosaurs did flourish in between. So why am I complaining?"

> "The paintings are 'right' in a narrow sense. But nothing can be more misleading than formally correct but limited information drastically yanked out of context. (Remember the old story about the captain who disliked his first mate and recorded in the ship's log, after a unique episode, "First mate was drunk today." The mate begged the captain to remove the passage, stating correctly that this had never happened before and that his employment would be jeopardized. The captain refused. The mate kept the next day's log, and he recorded, "Captain was sober today.")

> "As for this nautical tale, so for the history of life. All the prominent paintings in this genre of prehistoric art claim to be portraying the nub or essence of life's history through time. They all begin with a scene or two of Paleozoic invertebrates. We note our first bias even here, for the prevertebrate seas span nearly half the history of multicellular animal life, yet never commandeer more than 10 percent of the pictures. As soon as fishes begin to prosper in the Devonian period, underwater scenes switch to these first vertebrates–and we never see another invertebrate again for all the rest of the pageant. Even the fishes get short shrift, for not a single one ever appears again (except as fleeing prey for a an ichthyosaur or a mosauar) after the emergence of the terrestrial vertebrate life toward the end of the Paleozoic era...Invertebrates didn't die or stop evolving after fishes appeared; much of their most important history unrolls in contemporaneous partnership with marine vertebrates...Similarly, fishes didn't die out or stop evolving just because one lineage of peripheral brethren managed to colonize the land."

> "Let me not carp unfairly. If these pageantries only claimed to be illustrating the ancestry of our tiny human twig on life's tree, then I would not complain, for I cannot quarrel unduly with such a parochial decision, stated up front. But these iconographic sequences always purport to be illustrating *the* history of life, not a tale of a twig...Much as we may love ourselves, *Homo sapiens* is not representative, or symbolic, of life as a whole. We are not surrogates for arthropods (more than 80% of animal species), or exemplars of anything either particular or typical. We are the possessors of one extraordinary evolutionary investment called consciousness–the factor that permits us, rather than any other species, to ruminate about such matters (or, rather, cows ruminate and we cogitate). But how can this invention be viewed as the distillation of life's primary thrust or direction when 80 percent of multicellularity enjoys such evolutionary success and displays no trend to neurological complexity through time–and when our own neural elaboration may just as well end up destroying us as sparking a move to any other state that we would choose to designate as 'higher'?"

In light of our new (compared to the long history of Homo sapiens) self-understanding, Gould suggests we "trade the traditional source of human solace in separation for a more interesting view of life in union with other creatures as one contingent element of a much larger history. We must give up a conventional notion of human domination, but we learn to cherish particulars, of which we are but one, and to revel in the complete ranges, to which we contribute one precious point–a good swap, I would argue, of stale (and false) comfort for broader understanding. It is, indeed, a wonderful life within the full house of our planet's history of organic diversity."

Contrast the atheism of Gould with that of Stephen Pinker or Richard Dawkins, who explicitly deny the existence of God, but still implicitly speak as if the Great Commission were in effect. Theirs is another answer to the problem of how to deal with the death of God:

## The Humanist Solution: Ignore It

> Between believers and non-believers, there is only a razor's edge; on both sides of the razor, the abyss of willful ignorance.

From the ashes of God's demise, a simple solution rises: put Man in his place. Instead of the Natural and the Good being given to Man by God, the Natural and the Good will be given by Man to himself, in accordance with his own nature. This is the thrust of many currents of enlightenment rationalism, including my own dear Spinoza. This much Christian conservatives perceive and decry. What they react to is the audacity of Man determining his own ends. How, given Man's fallibility, his depravity, how dimly he sees, can he determine his own ends? And indeed, the history of modernity is the history of Man trying and failing to legislate itself. But what conservatives fail to see is that the Secular Humanists are but the other side of the coin of Christianity. As Nietzsche demonstrates, the death of God is Man's retroactive realization that he was always, in reality, legislating himself, whether he does so consciously and in his own name, or whether he attributes Nature to a separate being in Man's image called God. Through God, man makes the world in the image of himself. Whether believer or atheist, the thing that matters is whether one still sees the world in God/Man's image. Both flatter Man's vanity, irrespective of one's inclination toward perfectibility or fallibility.<sup><a id="foot7" href="#cite7">7</a></sup>

I don't personally know how Dawkins and Pinker maintain their optimism at the prospect of self-creating man, but I do not share it. However, true things are true whether or not they make your life more difficult. No doubt it is, in some senses, easier to believe that meaning and purpose are self-evident and eternal. No doubt it is easier to have certainty of what is and isn't natural, from a source that cannot be questioned. But I have no choice to embark on the terrible adventure of becoming worthy of the murder of God, a murder I fell into much as Adam and Eve fell into sin, a deed done before it was possible for them to comprehend its meaning. As I've come to understand it, the history of human life is comprised of a series of falls into seemingly insoluble problems. Maybe only a God can save us. But nothing could convince me to settle for a simulacra god, half-believed out of fear of what might happen if we consciously take the reigns that have been in our hands all along.

## The Post Humanist Solution: Change our subconscious idea of ourselves

While it should be obvious by now this is the solution I prefer, I confess it is nearly impossible. Subconscious models of the world don't need to be true to motivate behavior, and they don't necessarily respond to reasoning. At times, it feels like the modern world is implicitly atheist; whether one believes in God or not, most moderns, including conservatives, don't take seriously the idea that Humans are the center of the world. But at other times, it feels like the old model of Man as the apex of the natural world is alive, well, and consciously believed by most people. Modernity is in large part defined by this double vision, this inability to lock in a clear idea of our relationship to the world and its meaning.

This problem, the problem of modernity, is rather an old one. Nietzsche and his contemporaries attempted to go beyond it well before evolution became the generally accepted theory of the origin of life. What defines *post*modernity, for thinkers like Jean-François Lyotard, is not just our inability to believe in the centrality of man, but in any coherent, unifying theory of reality at all:

> "Science has always been in conflict with narratives. Judged by the yardstick of science, the majority of them prove to be fables. But to the extent that science does not restrict itself to stating useful regularities and seeks the truth, it is obliged to legitimate the rules of its own game. It then produces a discourse of legitimation with respect to its own status, a discourse called philosophy. I will use the term *modern* to designate any science that legitimates itself with reference to a metadiscourse of this kind making an explicit appeal to some grand narrative, such as the dialectics of Spirit, the hermeneutics of meaning, the emancipation of the rational or working subject, or the creation of wealth. For example, the rule of consensus between the sender and addressee of a statement with truth-value is deemed acceptable if it is cast in terms of a possible unanimity between rational minds: this is the Enlightenment narrative, in which the hero of knowledge works toward a good ethico-political end–universal peace. As can be seen from this example, if a metanarrative implying a philosophy of history is used to legitimate knowledge, questions are raised concerning the validity of the institutions governing the social bond: these must be legitimated as well. Thus justice is consigned to the grand narrative in the same way as truth."

> "Simplifying to the extreme, I define postmodernity as incredulity toward metanarratives. This incredulity is undoubtedly a product of progress in the sciences: but that progress in turn presupposes it. To the obsolescence of the metanarrative apparatus of legitimization corresponds; most notably, the crisis of metaphysical philosophy and of the university institution which in the past relied on it. The narrative function is losing it functors, its great hero, its great dangers, its great voyages, its great goal. It is being dispersed in clouds of narrative language elements–narrative, but also denotative, prescriptive, descriptive, and so on. Conveyed within each cloud are pragmatic valencies specific to its kind. Each of us lives at the intersection of many of these. However, we do not necessarily establish stable language combinations, and the properties of the ones we do establish are not necessarily communicable."

> "Thus the society of the future falls less within the province of a Newtonian anthropology (such as stucturalism or systems theory) than a pragmatics of language particles. There are many different language games-a heterogeneity of elements. They only give rise to institutions in patches-local determinism."

> "The decision makers, however, attempt to manage these clouds of sociality according to input/output matrices, following a logic which implies that their elements are commensurable and that the whole is determinable. They allocate our lives for the growth of power. In matters of social justice and of scientific truth alike, the legitimation I of that power is based on its optimizing the system's performance–efficiency. The application of this criterion to all of our games necessarily entails a certain level of terror, whether soft or hard: be operational (that is, commensurable) or disappear. The logic of maximum performance is no doubt inconsistent in many ways, particularly with respect to contradiction in the socio-economic field: it demands both less work (to lower production costs) and more (to lessen the social burden of the idle population). But our incredulity is now such that we no longer expect salvation to rise from these inconsistencies, as did Marx."

Since the collapse of the Soviet Union and the defeat of communism, we passed from a time when alternative metanarratives competed to define the meaning of history, to an era in which no one *really* believes history has a meaning. Those who do seem almost comically credulous and out of touch (irony and cringe culture.) We spend more time arguing and telling stories than ever, but none of them seem to take hold of us, and we need more of them than ever. It is in this sense that I talk about "postmodern" conservatism; it fixates on Culture Wars, lacks any positive or coherent political program, and the only sense in which it attempts to tell a totalizing story is negatively through the creation of relentless, external enemies. But it is not just conservatism; our politics seem dominated by this frenzied statis, all the more metastable the more it keeps us in a state of constant excitation and exhaustion.

How to overcome to this impasse? Can we can *will* ourselves back into believing in a lost totality? Perhaps the constant demand to restore a common language, a common *sense* is *itself* part of how the system reinforces itself. Lyotard, far from being against postmodernity, points out the "severe reexamination which postmodernity imposes on the thought of the Enlightenment, on the idea of a unitary end of history and of a subject", an "illusion" which can only be maintained through "terror". "The nineteenth and twentieth centuries have given us as much terror as we can take. We have paid a high enough price for the nostalgia of the whole and the one, for the reconciliation of the concept and the sensible, of the transparent and the communicable experience. Under the general demand for slackening and for appeasement, we can hear the mutterings of the desire for a return of terror, for the realization of the fantasy to seize reality. The answer is: Let us wage a war on totality; let us be witness to the unpresentable; let us activate the differences and save the honor of the name."

To not give into the temptation to let a fantasy seize reality is, as near as I can formulate it, the essence of anti-nihilism. All this thinking and speaking and acting and analyzing and buying and selling and yet the engine of capital churns on, grinding every human practice and belief into a salable commodity, tuning our every thought and reaction up to a codeable, manageable fever pitch. "A long twilight that bleeds out to the edges of time where even the most fantastic things become banal." Who knows where it will end? If nothing else, be kind.

<a id="cite2" href="#foot2">2.</a> Fundamentalist minister Vernon C. Lyons writes in his ludicrous essay [Why Baptists Are Not Protestants](https://acbc.ie/resources/PDF%27s-&-Files/Why-Baptists-are-not-Protestants.pdf): "Baptists make no effort to trace a historical succession back to the age of the Apostles. Their only claim is that at every age in church history there have been groups that have held to the same doctrines that Baptists hold today... [by contrast,] the Protestant groups look to some human being as their founder, often even taking their name from a man. The Lutherans arise with Luther. The Reformed look to John Calvin. The Presbyterians were founded by John Knox. The Methodists openly acknowledge John Wesley as their founder. Who founded the Baptist churches? Here is a historical question worthy of serious investigation [by who? Surely not Baptists??]. It is impossible [!!] to find any one man who gave rise to Baptist churches. Rather, if we would name human founders, we must look back to Peter, Paul, James and John." This ahistorical assertion is a time honored tradition among sectarian Protestants; what has any Protestant denomination ever said about itself, but that it is, at long last, a return to the scriptures?

<a id="cite4" href="#foot4">4.</a> Throughout this section, I use he/him pronouns to refer to the *Deus siva Natura* described by Spinoza, in conformity with his own style. I made this choice because I feel, as no doubt Spinoza did also, that they would make his concepts more digestible to people used to speaking of God in anthropomorphic terms. I want to be clear however, that I don't think it makes any sense to attribute such human traits as gender to the supreme cause.

<a id="cite5" href="#foot5">5.</a> It is common knowledge at this point that conservative and liberal as dispositions have a biological basis; how sensitive a person is to the physical sensation of disgust is highly predictive of their political beliefs. Beyond the basic acceptance that this link exists however, one must be exceedingly careful not reductively assume that conservatism as a political movement is comprised of the anal-retentive individuals, while liberalism captures the diarrhetic; many if not most liberals I've encountered have shockingly weak stomachs for novelty. Not that this implies the reverse is more than rarely true, as self-identified conservatives cannot without hypocrisy avow a taste for the new.

<a id="cite6" href="#foot6">6.</a> For the record, I think that the monopoly of capital over the means of communication is absolutely a crisis which demands immediate action. But if we're being consistent, part of free speech in market liberalism is that, if you own a platform, you have the right to exclude speech you don't like, for any reason. Conservatives were fine with this dynamic when conservative ideas garnered more respect in the mainstream; now that capital has in many cases gone Woke, they find this feature of market liberalism unacceptable.

<a id="cite7" href="#foot7">7.</a>  This is what Freud calls the "narcissism of minor differences". People who's ideas and assumptions are ultimately very similar to us, except for their answer to one or two questions, appear to be more different than us than people who's concepts are so foreign, they fail to agitate us. This is easy to spot in others once you have the concept, but hard to apply to yourself.
