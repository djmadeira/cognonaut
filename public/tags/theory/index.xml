      <description>Alienation from gender archetypes Alienation from the gods Alienation from our minds Carl Jung often described something he called the &amp;ldquo;Collective Unconscious&amp;rdquo;, a realm beyond any one individual&amp;rsquo;s lived experience from which we draw the types that we embody in our everyday lives. Different individuals might have a stronger affinity to different aspects of this collective unconscious, and our persona becomes a mix of the types with which we (unconsciously) identify most strongly.</description>
